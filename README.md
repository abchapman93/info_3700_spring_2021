Class repository for UVU's Spring 2021 Health Informatics Fundamentals (INFO-3700)

# Overview
Since the introduction of electronic health records in the 1960's, healthcare has become one of the most information-rich industries. Data is needed to enable consistent and quality patient care, help make clinical decisions, and understand the health of a population. Healthcare data is also extremely complex and often challenging to work with. A great deal of data is siloed in individual institutions, which prevents creating a holistic view of a patient. Data might also be messy, particularly unstructured data like clinical text narratives and medical imaging.

Healthcare Informatics studies how to create, manage, share, and analyze this data in order to improve the healthcare process. Informatics is critical to the success of a modern healthcare system. In the age of COVID-19, it is particularly important that we be developing and improving Informatics capabilities to respond to the pandemic.

In this course, you will learn how information technology is used in healthcare. You will work with real-world data to analyze patients' conditions and treatment. You will also study examples where healthcare IT can cause risk or harm and understand the ethical implications of using IT in healthcare.

# Units
The course will be broken up into 5 units:
1. Electronic Health Records
2. Working with Clinical Data
3. Interoperability and Terminologies
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Public Health and Biosurveillance

# How to use this Repository
Materials will be added throughout the semester. Each unit will be placed in a separate subdirectory. Materials will consist mostly of Jupyter Notebooks.
