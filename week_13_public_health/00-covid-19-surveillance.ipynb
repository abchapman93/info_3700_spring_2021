    "# Overview\n",
    "Our Public Health module is happening during a time when the role of public health is very apparent. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted daily life across the entire globe. The analysis and reporting done by epidemiologists and public health organizations has become a vital source of information. We are probably all familiar with the graphs showing the growth and spread of COVID-19. In this notebook, we'll perform some of that analysis ourselves to analyze which countries have had the highest counts of COVID-19 and to analyze how the disease has spread both globally and in specific countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Health Surveillance\n",
    "Public health surveillance is the \"the continuous, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.\" [[WHO](https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/en/)]. In the context of COVID-19, this means collecting, analyzing, and reporting data about the number of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because surveillance depends heavily on medical data for both collection and visualizaton, Informatics is a crucial piece of COVID-19 surveillance and public health surveillance more generally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 3 examples of COVID-19 surveillance systems:\n",
    "- [John Hopkins World Map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)\n",
    "- [Utah Department of Health COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard](https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/)\n",
    "- [US Department of Veterans Affairs Access to Care](https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/Healthcare/COVID19NationalSummary)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "Go to each of these websites and compare the data displayed in each dashboard. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the **scope** of the data? For example, is it global, national, or state-level? Does it include the entire population or focus on a specific sub-population?\n",
    "- What visualization tools are used in the dashboards?\n",
    "- In addition to overall COVID-19 counts, what other data elements are available to explore?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source and Notebook Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "This is partially based on the following DataCamp project in R: [Visualizing COVID-19](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/870). If you would prefer to complete this assignment in R, feel free to use the DataCamp project instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data used in this notebook can be found here: https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus-csv. The raw data was then preprocessed to show cumulative counts for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with John Hopkins Dashboard\n",
    "As you generate your visualizations, use the [John Hopkins World Map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) to compare your plots with the plots displayed on the John Hopkins dashboard. The numbers won't line up exactly but the general trends should look pretty similar."

If you'd like to learn more about forecasting, some good good resource are the DataCamp course [Forecasting in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/forecasting-in-r) and the corresponding textbook [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/).
