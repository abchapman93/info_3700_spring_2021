He was given intravenous \nboluses, transfused blood products and was placed on four \npressors: Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, Dobutamine, and Pitressin. \n(Later, pt was also placed on epinephrine gtt as well.) Pt \narrived with a Swan [**Last Name (un) 10309**] catheter, and cardiac parameters were \nhyperdynamic.\n\nGiven the pt's cardiac hx and mildly elevated cardiac enzyme, a \nSTAT cardiology consult was obtained. STAT TTE showed preserved \nEF and no grossly abnormal wall motions. There was no \npericardial effusion. All these findings essentially ruled out \ncardiogenic shock.\n\nPt arrived anuric to [**Hospital1 19**]. Pt was acidodic as well. Pt was \nstarted on sodium bicarbonate gtt. Nephrology consult was \nobtained. L femoral dialysis line was placed, and pt was \ninitiated on CVVH.\n\nLFT's began to rise, indicating likely shock liver.\n\nPresuming septic shock, pt was given broad spectrum IV \nantibiotics. Given the severity of the shock, he was also \nstarted on activated Protein C gtt.\n\nDespite all these measures, pt required increasingly higher \ndoses of all the pressors to maintain bp. Serum lactic acid \nlevel peaked to > 10. Ventilation was difficult, requiring FiO2 \nof 1.0 and high PEEP.\n\nFamily members were present and understood the critical state of \npt's multi-organ failure. When pt's blood pressure could not be \nmaintained, family members decided to make the pt DNR. Slowly, \npt became bradycardic and hypotensive. Cardiac arrest ensued. Pt \nwas pronounced deceased 4:45am, [**3298-4-12**].

A stone causing partial obstruction was seen in \nthe distal CBD. \nThere was dilation of the CBD above the stone however accurate \nradiographic evaluation could not be obtained due to the use of \nthe C-arm in the ICU. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 \no'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing \nguidewire. A 15mm balloon was used to sweep the duct multiple \ntimes wich successfully extracted stones, sludge and a large \namount of purulent material. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known patient lastname 2004**] was admitted on [**2573-5-30**]. Ultrasound at the time of \nadmission demonstrated pancreatic duct dilitation and an \nedematous gallbladder. She was admitted to the ICU. [**5-31**] she \nunderwent ERCP w\/ sphincterotomy, an impacted stone was removed. \nShe has had a prolonged ICU course. Review of hospital course by \nsystem includes.\nNeuro: Neurology was consutled on [**6-11**] for mental status \nchanges. The team believed the patient's MS [**First Name (Titles) 1935**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2005**] from \nher overall metabolic and infectious  conditions. A head CT was \nperformed which was negative. A lumbar puncture was also done \nwhich too was negative. \n\nCardiovascular: The cardiology team was consulted on [**6-1**] and a \nTTE was obtained showing decreased biventricular systolic \ndysfunction representing a diffuse process. On [**6-14**] a repeat TTE \nfollowed by a TEE was done to rule out endocarditis; no \nvegatation or abscess was seen. A TEE was again performed on \n[**6-22**] there was no significant change from the prior study. The \npatient was treated with amiodarone to control her atrial \nfibrillation. \n\nPulmonary: Patient was intubated on admission and transferred to \nthe ICU. Patient was initially extubated on hospital day six. \nThe patient was re-intubated on [**6-12**] for hypercarbic respiratory \nfailure and airway protection. The patient was extubated again \non [**6-18**] and re-intubated on [**6-19**] for respiratory decompensation. \nThe patient ultimately underwent a tracheostomy on [**6-24**]. The \npatient tolerated a trach mask on [**6-25**]. Bronchoscopy on [**6-26**] \nwith suctioning of bronchial plugs. CT chest on [**6-27**] showed \ncollapse of the left lung with left sided pleural effusion. Left \nsided thoracentesis was done on [**6-27**] to remove fluid with hope \nof re-expanding left lung.\n\nGI: Patient was admitted with a diagnosis of gallstone \npancreatitis, she underwent ERCP w\/ sphincterotomy on [**5-31**]. Her \ntube feeds were started due anticipation of a  prolonged period \nwithout orally based enteral nutrition. [**6-9**] patient had a CT \nscan of the abdomen,it showed no gallstones or abscess. A \npost-pyloric dobhoff was placed on [**6-14**]. The patient's caloric \nintake was maintained by a combination of TPN and tube feeds. \nEach nutritional replacment was employed at different times \nindependently of the other based on the patient's tolerance for \ntube feeds or TPN.\n\nFEN: Patient was dehydrated, with hypovolemia and treated with \naggressive fluid hydration upon admission to the hospital. Tube \nfeeds were held on [**6-30**] due to high residuals. Currently the \npatient is not on TPN, while nutrition more recently has been \nmaintained with tube feeds.\n\nRenal: Foley in place to monitor urine output.\n\nHeme: Blood loss and anemia in the unit requiring multiple \ntransfusions. Currently, hematocrit is stable.\n\nID: Consult was obtained on [**6-12**] the ID team continued to follow \nthe patient throughout her entire hospital stay.

Differential\n91% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated\nfor clinical respiratory distress and hypoxia.  She\nsubsequently developed adult respiratory distress syndrome\npresumed secondary to right sided pneumonia versus radiation\npneumonitis versus both.  She was maintained on the\nventilator with SIMV mode ventilation and required high\nlevels of FIO2, PEEP to maintain oxygenation as well as a\nsignificant high respiratory rate to maintain appropriate\nventilation in the setting of low tidal volume due to her\nsingle lung.  She was started on Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin\nand Flagyl for coverage of pneumonia.  Her Ceftriaxone was\nsubsequently discontinued and she was continued just on\nLevofloxacin and Flagyl.  She was also started on high dose\nsteroids for radiation pneumonitis.  Over the course of her\nhospitalization she continued to have significant oxygenation\nproblems and continued to require high respiratory rates to\nmaintain appropriate ventilation.\n\n2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was hypotensive and required\npressors for blood pressure support.  Her hypotension was\npresumed due to sepsis.  The patient was initially listed as\nfull code on admission.  Upon further discussion with the\nfamily it was revealed that the patient had not wanted\naggressive care and family members decided to withdraw\nsupport given her grim prognosis both from her underlying\nmetastatic lung cancer and her severe adult respiratory\ndistress syndrome.  It was determined that her baseline\nfunctional status was poor and that even if she were to\nrecover from her acute lung injury she would not return to\neven her poor baseline functioning.  Her ventilatory support\nwas withdrawn on [**4-11**] and the patient subsequently passed\naway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          DR.[**Last Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] 11-685\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 4483**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2692-5-12**]  15:29\nT:  [**2692-5-16**]  07:34\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 13176**]\nSigned electronically by: DR.

Cardiac catheterization revealed an\naortic valve peak gradient of 80 with estimated valve surface\narea of 0.5 cm2 and severely elevated filling pressures with\nprominent V waves.  Cardiac catheterization showed 30% ostial\nleft circumflex lesion with mild left anterior descending\nartery and right coronary artery luminal irregularities.\nLeft ventriculogram showed a left ventricular ejection\nfraction of 60%, 3+ mitral regurgitation and normal wall\nmotion.\n\nThe patient underwent scheduled aortic valvuloplasty on day\none of this admission, which showed a peak gradient of 60 mm\nof mercury and a valve area of 0.4 cm2.  After valvuloplasty\nthe gradient was reduced to 30 mm of mercury and the valve\nsurface area increased to 0.6 cm2.  A new left bundle branch\nblock was noted on a post intervention electrocardiogram with\na heart rate of 75.\n\nThe patient was then taken back to the catheterization\nlaboratory for placement of a temporary ventricular pacing\nwire.  A repeat electrocardiogram after this procedure showed\natrial fibrillation without left bundle branch block.  The\natrial fibrillation is chronic.  There were no pacer spikes\non this tracing.  The patient's pulmonary artery pressure was\n61\/22 with a mean of 40.  At this point, the patient was\ntransferred to the Coronary Care Unit for 24 hours of\nobservation.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Congestive heart failure.\n2.  Atrial fibrillation.\n3.

Neurologic\nexamination:  No focal neurological deficits, alert and\noriented times three.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular heart rate,\nIV\/VI harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, mild\npitting pretibial edema.  Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to\nauscultation bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen:\nSoft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Temporary\npacing wire in right groin.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 31.4, creatinine 1,\nand INR 1.2.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  After transfer to the Coronary Care Unit,\nthe patient did not develop further conduction problems.\nSeveral times she had brief bursts of a rapid atrial\nfibrillation, which spontaneously resolved on their own.  Her\nCoumadin was held for the procedure and it was restarted,\nalong with subcutaneous heparin 5,000 units twice a day until\nthe INR is therapeutic.  The patient tolerated the procedure\nwell and there were no complications.\n\nThe patient was to be discharged on [**2789-7-5**], but had a\nlow grade temperature of 100.1 in the morning and stated that\nshe did not feel well, more specifically that she was a\nlittle bit dizzy.  Blood cultures were obtained, a chest\nx-ray was obtained and the patient was held for a further 24\nhours for observation.  On the morning of discharge, her\nsymptoms of dizziness had resolved.  She had no further\ntemperature spikes, with blood cultures showing no growth at\nthe time of discharge and a chest x-ray showing mild\ncongestive heart failure.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable for discharge home\nwith VNA services.  She will receive subcutaneous heparin\ninjections 5,000 units twice a day until her INR is\ntherapeutic.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow up Monday at the Coumadin\nClinic for an INR check and Coumadin adjustment.  She will\nfollow up in two to three weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Since she\nwas having bursts of atrial fibrillation with rapid\nventricular response on her current Lopressor dose, she may\nneed an increase in the dose of this medication.

She had had previous\nclipping of an unruptured right MCA aneurysm 8 years ago in\nelective fashion at an outside institution. The patient was taken\nemergently to the Operating Room on [**2966-4-29**] for evacuation\nof sylvian fissure hematoma which led to herniation syndrome with\na blown pupil in the ED. She subsequently underwent cerebral\nangiography which showed that she had a large MCA aneurysm\nrecurrence\/regrowth under the clip blades.  Accordingly, on [**2966-4-30**], she was taken back to the Operating Room for clipping\nof a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.  She had a vent drain\nplaced on [**5-2**] and an angio on [**5-3**], that showed good\nplacement of the clip. The previous clip could not be removed\nbecause it had fused to the tissue.  She was intubated in an\noutside hospital for transport to [**Hospital6 725**].  She was awake and alert preintubation.  On arrival to\nthe Emergency Room she was withdrawing her lower extremities,\nflexor posturing her upper extremities with no eye opening.  She\nhad serratia in her blood and sputum on [**5-6**] and fungus in\nher blood on [**5-6**].  Postoperative neurologically the\npatient's pupils were equal and reactive, she had localized\nstimulation on the right, flexors on the left.  She continued to\nbe followed by the Infectious Disease Service for serratia and\nfungus in her blood.  She was on Kefzol, Levofloxacin and\nFluconazole for intravenous antibiotic coverage.  On [**2966-5-20**],\nfor neurologic status she withdrew her arm with noxious\nstimulation.  Her left arm appeared to be posturing.\nBilateral toes were positive Babinski, opening eyes\noccasionally with noxious stimulation, did not follow\ncommands and did not track with her eyes.  Spontaneous\nmovement of the right arm only.  Pupils equal, round and\nreactive to light.  Vent drain was leveled at 10 cm above the\ntragus and opened to drainage.  She had multiple surveillance\ncultures sent, and her cerebrospinal fluid came back\nnegative.  On her second craniotomy, she did have her\ncraniectomy as well as craniotomy and her flap remained full\nand soft.  Her dressing was clean, dry and intact.  She had a\ntracheostomy placement on [**2966-5-21**] without complications,\nand percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placed at the same\ntime.  She had a repeat head computerized tomography scan on\n[**2962-5-23**] which showed minimal subacute left frontal fluid\nand no new hemorrhage or mass effect.  On [**2966-5-30**], the\npatient was responding to voice, squeezing of the right hand.\nHer flap was soft, and she continued to have a hemiparesis on\nher left side.  [**2966-6-6**], the patient was taken to the\nOperating Room for replacement of craniectomy.  There was no\nintraoperative complications.  She also had a right\nventriculoperitoneal shunt placed.  Postoperative vital signs\nwere stable.  She was afebrile.  She was awake, responding to\ncommands on the right side.  Her incision was clean, dry and\nintact.  She remained neurologically stable and was\ntransferred to the regular floor on [**2966-6-8**].  She\nremains neurologically stable, following commands on the\nright side.  Her dressing is clean, dry and intact.  Her head\ncomputerized tomography scan on [**6-9**], showed good placement\nof the ventriculoperitoneal shunt with effacement of the\nlateral ventricle.

She was \nconverted to sinus after cardioversion.  She was subsequently \nloaded with amiodarone started on [**3165-3-1**]. She is to receive \n200mg BID until [**3-14**], 200mg ONCE a day from [**3-14**], \nand 100mg once a day from [**3-29**] onward for maintenance \ntherapy.  She should have a TSH and Liver enzymes checked in 1-2 \nweeks after discharge, as TSH will be unreliable in the setting \nof acute illness.  Continue aspirin for anticoagulation.  Will \nhold off on further anticoagulation given age and risk of fall, \nand also may not even require this long-term if she stays in \nsinus rhythm.\n.  \n# ST-elevations: Patient had initial ST-elevations on initial \npresentation to the ED.  The case was discussed with \ninterventionalist on call and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and decision was made \nfor medical management. ECG done shortly after arrival and after \nspontaneous conversion to NSR with rate in the 60's shows \nresolution of ST and T changes, suggesting demand ischemia as \netiology more likely than acute STEMI. Patient had episode of \nleft-sided sharp chest pain on [**3165-3-2**] that was tender to \npalpation on examination. Her cardiac biomarkers were markedly \nelevated, although this is difficult to interpret in setting of \nrecent cardioversion.  Continue with aspirin, metoprolol.  \n.  \n# Respiratory failure\/hypoxia: Initial episode of hypoxia may \nhave been secondary to CHF. Required intubation. Extubated on \n[**3-1**] after discussion with son, and is DNR\/DNI. Tolerated \nextubation well.  Weaned off of oxygen successfully.  Will start \non low-dose diuretics given history of aortic stenosis.  Also \nmay have component of pneumonia.  Treating with cefpodoxime, to \ncomplete course on [**3165-3-7**].\n.  \n# Bacteriuria:  No pyuria, however, patient presented in rapid \natrial fibrillation and this could be early indication of \nsymptomatic infection.  Culture data negative.  Will treat with \ncefpodoxime, as has history of TMP\/SMX resistance and also risk \nof QT prolongation with fluoroquinolones since also on \namiodarone load.  7-day course of cefpodoxime since also \ntreating empirically for pneumonia as above.\n.  \n# Access: HCP states that pt. would not want Central line - NO \nCENTRAL LINE  \n.  \n# Code: DNR\/DNI: discussed with HCP. Explained to him that this \ninformation was not available to the ED physicians on \npresentation and therefore, she was cardioverted and intubated \nas indicated at the time.

EKG reportedly showed anterolateral ST\nelevations and the patient ruled in for an myocardial\ninfarction but refused repeated advice for cardiac\ncatheterization on the 4th and [**4-15**].\n\nThe patient was transiently intubated for a question of a\nsystolic arrest versus bradycardic event, but recovered\nwithin less than one day.  Again, during hemodialysis on [**4-18**], the patient developed recurrent chest pain and agreed to\na transfer to [**Hospital1 4**] for\ncardiac catheterization.  Please see catheterization report\nfor full details and summary.\n\nThe catheterization showed the patient to have severe three\nvessel disease with significantly elevated pulmonary\npressures, left main 70%, left anterior descending 90%, 90%\nof circumflex, right coronary artery 90%.  PA was 72\/24 with\na wedge of 34.\n\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the\nCatheterization Laboratory and the patient was transferred to\nthe Cardiac Care Unit for continuing care.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

Sodium 140, potassium 5.1,\nchloride 100, CO2 21, BUN 44, creatinine 8.1.  Glucose 144.\nCK 357.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was cared for by the Cardiology\nTeam for the first three hospital days.  He remained\nhemodynamically stable.  He was brought to dialysis on\nseveral occasions where some fluid was taken off and on [**4-22**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room at which\ntime he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four.\nPlease see the Operating Room report for full details.\n\nIn summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft\ntimes four with a left internal mammary artery to the left\nanterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,\nsaphenous vein graft to PDA and PL sequentially.  His bypass\ntime was 115 minutes.  His cross clamp time was 95 minutes.\nHe tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the\nOperating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAt the time of transfer, the patient had a mean arterial\npressure of 66.  He was in a paced rhythm at 80 beats per\nminute.  He had Milrinone at 0.5 mics per kilogram per\nminute.  He did well in the immediate postoperative period.\nThe patient had a metabolic acidosis and was therefore kept\nsedated and ventilated.\n\nOn postoperative day one, his Milrinone was decreased.  His\nintra-aortic balloon pump was weaned and ultimately\ndiscontinued.  He was weaned from the ventilator and\nsuccessfully extubated.  He also was dialyzed on\npostoperative day one.\n\nDuring that period, the patient remained hemodynamically\nstable, however, he required a Neo-Synephrine drip to\nmaintain an adequate blood pressure.  Over the next two days,\nthe patient's Milrinone drip was weaned to off.  During that\nperiod, the patient continued to need a Neo-Synephrine drip\nto maintain an adequate blood pressure.  He remained\nhemodynamically stable.\n\nOn postoperative day three, the patient's chest tubes and\npacing wires and Swan-Ganz catheter were discontinued.\nHowever, after initially being weaned off Neo-Synephrine, the\npatient was put back on Neo-synephrine because of\nhypotension.  He remained on Neo-Synephrine over the next two\ndays.\n\nOn postoperative day six, after hemodialysis, he was weaned\nfrom his Neo-Synephrine and ultimately transferred to the\nfloor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac\nrehabilitation.\n\nOver the next three days with the assistance of the nursing\nstaff and Physical Therapy, the patient's activity level was\nincreased.  It was noted on postoperative day eight, that he\nhad a small amount of bloody sternal drainage.  His incision\nwas Dermabonded at that time.  He continued to have a small\namount of bloody drainage following that.\n\nOn postoperative day nine, it was decided that the patient\nwas stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation for\ncontinuing care and rehabilitation following surgery.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of transfer, the patient's\nphysical examination is as follows:  Vital signs with\ntemperature 98.2 F.; heart rate 84; sinus rhythm; blood\npressure 150\/50; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 94% on\ntwo liters nasal prongs.

She was then weaned off oxygen onto room \nair.  \n*\n2)Pneumonia exaceCeftriaxone\/azith were started on admission \nwhich was eventually changed to levofloxacin such that she \ncompleted a 10 day course.\n*\n3)Obstructive [**Doctor Last Name 292**] apnea: She continued to desaturate \nperiodically at night for which she was started on bipap with \ngood effect but the patient refused to wear the bipap mask.  She \nalso underwent an inpatient [**Doctor Last Name 292**] study but this was terminated \nearly secondary to her refusal to wear the bipap mask.  (An \ninterpreter was present.)\n*\n4)Psych - Pt was originally started on her home psych meds (see \nmeds on admission).  However zyprexa and depakote were stopped \ndue to possible respiratory depression.  Psychiatry was \nconsulted and they thought that the patient had dementia and \nresolving delerium.  Her standing haldol was discontinued and \nshe was started on zyprexa prn agitation. \n*\n5) Neuro - CT of the head demonstrated basal ganlia lesion and a \npannus in the upper cervical spine.  MRI done to further \nevaluate which demonstrated: a Posterior vertebral pannus \nformation C1-C2, with compression\/stenosis of the spinal cord as \nit exits the foramen magnum. There was no evidence of \nintracranial hemorrhage, or minor or major vascular territorial \ninfarction. Chronic lacunar infarcts were also observed \nNeurosurg consulted.  The spoke to the pts home neurosurgeon at \n[**Hospital **] Hospital and found that this was a problem that had \nalready been worked up.  Because of her poor baseline functional \nstatus the pt was felt to be a poor surgical candidate.  She was \nplaced in a cervical collar which she refused to wear.\n*\n6)In light of the continued improvement in her mental status we \n(the medical team and the patient's family) thought that it \nwould be best if the patient were transferred to a rehab\/long \nterm care center where she could prepare for the upcoming \nsurgery should her family decide to procede. At this time the \nfamily deferred surgery in light of her condition.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nKCl 10mg qday\nLasix 40mg qday\nProzac 20mg qday\nCelebrex 20mg qday\nColace 100 mg bid\nEcotrin 81 mg qday\nProtonix 40mg qday\nDepakotote 250mg qam\/ 500mg qpm\nZyprexa 10mg bid\nAbilify 10mg qam\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n \nFacility:\nBlue Hills Alzheimer Care Center\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\n1.

The patient began experimental\nchemotherapy on [**10-4**].  The patient presented to the\nOncology Clinic on [**10-7**] with the complaints of\northopnea and lower extremity edema, which was felt to be\nconsistent with CHF.  The patient was given 20 mg IV Lasix\nand sent home with 40 mg Lasix PO.  At home, the patient\nreportedly diuresed about 5 kg overnight and then\nsubsequently developed weakness and vomiting on\n[**10-8**], 2002.  The patient was seen at the [**Hospital1 74**] Emergency Department on the [**10-8**] for worsening shortness of breath.  The patient had a\nhypertensive and bradycardiac episode in the emergency\ndepartment that that was afebrile.  The patient was noticed\nto be lethargic with oxygen saturations 95% on room air.  EKG\nshowed no changes.  Labs were notable for acute renal\nfailure, increased white blood count.  The patient was given\nIV fluids for low blood pressure and subsequently developed\nincreased shortness of breath.  ABGs were 7.04, 87, 102.  The\npatient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.\nInitial bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis with\nejection fraction of 25% to 30%.  The patient was transferred\nto the MICU and started on dopamine drip for hypertension.\n\nCeftazidime and Vancomycin were initiated before possible\nsepsis.\n\nThe hospital course was notable for the following:\n1.  HYPERTENSION:   It was unclear whether the etiology of\nhypertension was sepsis versus cardiogenic versus hypovolemia\nsecondary to over diuresis.  The patient responded well to IV\nfluids, pressors were weaned off.  Subsequently, the patient\nbecame hypertensive and less volume overloaded.  He was given\nIV Lasix 20 mg times two with urine output.  The patient was\ndetermined to be highly Lasix sensitive.  The patient was\nstarted on Losartan, Hydralazine, and titrated up on these\nmedications.  IV Nipride was used in the MICU for help in\nblood pressure control.\n\n2.  BRADYCARDIA:  Bradycardia was felt to be secondary to\ncalcium channel blocker and beta blocker in the setting of\nacute renal failure; resolved after starting these\nmedications.\n\n3.  CHF:  CHF in the setting of volume overload.  The patient\nhad positive troponin, but negative CKMBs.  Repeat\nechocardiogram showed increased mitral regurgitation from 2+\nto 4+.  Focal akinesis in the septum and apex, as compared to\nglobal hypokinesis on the first echocardiogram, 2+ tricuspid\nregurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction\nincreased from 30% to 35%, as compared to 25 to 30 initially.\n\nEchocardiogram findings and troponin were felt to be\nsecondary to strain secondary to increased blood pressure.\nIV Nipride was used in the MICU to help with afterload\nreduction.\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially on Vancomycin,\nLevofloxacin.  Ceftazidime was changed to Cefepime for\npossible sepsis.  No source was identified.  Elevated white\ncount could have been secondary to steroids.  The patient\ncompleted seven days Cefepime on [**10-14**].  Chest x-rays\nwere positive for possible atelectasis versus infiltrates.\n\nACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Suspected per renal etiology versus\ndrug toxicity.  BUN and creatinine was normalized at the end\nof the unit stay.  The patient had been getting IV Lasix 20\nmg IV once a day.\n\nRESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated for\nhypercarbic failure.  The patient had some issues with\ndelicate fluid balance.\n\nANEMIA:  Hematocrit trended downwards.  Stool guaiacs were\nnegative.  Hemolysis labs were negative.\n\nDIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was covered by regular\ninsulin sliding scale.\n\nMr. [**Known patient lastname 675**] was transferred to the regular floor from the MICU\non [**10-15**].  He did very well after that.  He began\nambulation the next day.  Repeat echocardiogram was done on\nthe day of discharge on [**10-18**].  The results of the\nrepeat echocardiogram were pending at the time of this\ndictation.  Hematocrit remained stable.  The patient was\ndischarged to home with VNA services on a regular diet on the\nfollowing medications:\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.  Aspirin 81 mg PO q.d.\n2.

Once on the floor and stable, the patient received\nPTC of the left side to finish decompression of his biliary\nsystem, considering his elevation of the total bilirubin\nlevel.  The patient underwent left sided PTC by\ninterventional radiology without any complications.  A repeat\nCAT scan of the abdomen revealed a stable, subcapsular,\nhepatic hematoma which had not changed in size.  There was no\nevidence of active extravasation.\n\nTransthoracic echocardiogram noted a possible pericardial\neffusion and this was evaluated with CT of the chest which\nshowed no pericardial effusion but worsening of the right\npleural effusion which extends across the posterior\nmediastinum. There was also a small effusion on the left.\nThe patient underwent a thoracentesis of the right chest,\ndraining 1.5 liters of old clotted blood.  The patient\nunderwent the procedure without any complications.\n\nConsidering his differential diagnosis of primary sclerosing\ncholangitis versus Klatskin tumor, the patient underwent\nultrasound guided needle biopsy of the liver.

Worsening \nintraventricular \nhemorrhage. \n\n[**3235-10-18**] - stable\n\nEEG\n[**3235-10-24**] - Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized\nbackground and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings \nindicate a\nwidespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and\nsubcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and\ninfection are among the most common causes. There were no areas \nof\nprominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features\n\nBILATERAL LE ULTRASOUND\n[**3235-10-22**] - Occlusive superficial venous thrombosis w\/in R greater \nsaphenous vein extending to 1 cm from the junction with the \ncommon femoral vein.

No valvular mass \nor vegetation seen. Mild AR, trivial TR.\n\nREPEAT CT SCAN [**11-9**]:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is approximately \nstable in size. \nThe degree of mass effect is approximately unchanged. \n2. Small amount of intraventricular blood. \n3. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n67 year old man on Coumadin with very large R basal ganglia \nhemorrhage (>100cc) with \nintraventricular extension. Hypertension (in the setting of \nelevated INR) is the most likely etiology of the hemorrhage \ngiven the patient's history and the location of the bleed. \nAdditional possibilities include AVM, aneurysm, or mass lesion.  \n\n\nNeuro - Increased intracranial pressure was initially managed \nwith hyperventilation and Mannitol. The Pt was sedated with \nPropofol until [**10-17**]. He was loaded with Dilantin on admission.  \nDilantin was discontinued on [**10-25**] due to concerns for drug fever \n(see ID course).  No seizure activity observed off of \nanti-epileptic medications.  After approximately three weeks \nsince admission, the patient began to have signs of improvement \nof neurological status.  He began following commands to raise \nhis hand, and several days later, openned his eyes spontaneously \nand was moving his right side purposefully.  According to \nnurses, he was able to talk a bit, although this was not \nobserved by our team.  See \"Physical exam\" section for discharge \nexam.\n\nCV - Blood pressure initially controlled with Labetalol gtt. \nTransitioned to Metoprolol, Diltiazem was added for improved \nrate control of intermittent atrial fibrillation.  The week of \n[**11-5**], he had increased heart rate with low blood \npressures, and was unable to tolerate these antihypertensives.  \nHis cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2936**] was contacted, and with his \nsuggestion, the patient was loaded with digoxin and started on \n0.125 mg each day of digoxin.  He tolerated this dose well, and \nwhen his heart rate trended up the following week, the digoxin \ndose was increased to 0.250 mg.  Diltiazem was continued but \nwith strict holding parameters for sbp<105 (and hr 60).  \nMetoprolol was discontinued, as his blood pressures had dropped \nto the 80s systolic.\n\nResp - The patient was intubated initially and ventilated.  A \ntracheostomy was placed on [**10-19**]. He was eventually weaned off \nventilator support to O2 via trach collar and mask.  He was \ntolerating 20% FiO2 on the day of discharge, with plans to wean \nO2 further to tolerate sats<93%.\n\nFEN\/GI - Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed on [**10-19**], \ncurrently tolerating feeds well.\n\nID - At the time of admission, Pt was being treated with Keflex \nfor a LLE cellulitis. Started Cefazolin IV. Became febrile on \n[**10-16**] despite resolving cellulitis. Remained febrile through \n[**10-31**]. Treated with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin during this time \nperiod, initially empiric treatment for presumed aspiration \npneumonia. However fever persisted after CXR improved and weaned \nfrom ventilator support. Extensive fever workup (in conjunction \nwith consulting ID service) included multiple negative blood, \nurine and sputum cultures, negative Cdiff, negative \nchest\/abd\/pelvis CT, and negative echocardiogram (no \nvegetations). One out of >10 blood cultures  grew two colonies \nof coag negative staph at >24hours, thought to represent a \ncontaminated specimen. Drug fever was considered, but fever \npersisted after discontinuation of Dilantin. All central lines \nwere removed and cultured as well. Fever resolved on [**11-1**], \nexact source of fever remained unclear. However, he then had a \nrepeat fever on [**11-2**], and had positive lower extremity \nultrasounds for clot in the femoral vein.  (See below.)  Despite \ntreatment, he continued to spike daily.  ID was involved and \nsuggested discontinuing all antibiotics when he had low-grade \ntemperatures.  This was done, and within days, he continued to \nspike to 101.  A C-Diff that was sent earlier came back \npositive, and metronidazole was started, for a 14 day total \ncourse.  Unfortunately, even seven days into treatment, he \nremained febrile.  This was felt to be likely related to \n\"central fever,\" with his intracranial damage.  To be sure, a \nwhite blood cell tagged scan was performed on the day of \ndischarge.  This was significant for some uptake at the trach \nsite, which could be consistent with the presence of granulation \ntissue from placement in late September.  This was not \nconsidered his fever source, thus the source was considered to \nbe \"central fever,\" which can occur in patients with significant \nhead injury.  His 14 day course of metronidazole should be \ncompleted; if he is febrile (as he has been every night), \ncentral fever should be considered the primary cause.  If \ninfection is suspected, other markers should be used for \nworkup-- ie, increased secretions or cough, low O2 sats, \ndiarrhea, hematuria, etc. rather than fever.  CBC should be \nchecked, and the trach site should be inspected.\n\nHeme: Coagulopathy (INR 3.2) on admission was reversed with FFP, \nProplex, and three day course of Vitamin K. Received additional \nFFP prior to PEG placement. Superficial LE thrombi, now with \nnon-occlusive thrombus in the R common femoral vein. HCT stable. \n On [**11-2**], lower extremity ultrasounds were performed to look \nfor lower ext DVTs and initially found superficial clot only.  \nRepeat scan 10 days later showed extension of the right \nsuperficial saphenous clot into the common \nfemoral(non-occlusive).  This alone may cause low grade fevers.  \nBased on this, we felt he needed protection from PE.  Given that \nhis bleed is several weeks ago, we felt comfortable slowly \nrestarting coumadin.  This was done slowly and he was closely \nmonitored for rebleeding.  \n\nRenal - Creatinine increased to a max of 3.0 on [**10-20**]. Mannitol \nand Captopril were stopped, and the creatinine returned to \nbaseline of 0.6-1.0, where it has since remained.\n\nOrtho - Pt was found down. C-spine imaging negative for \nfracture, but patient must be awake and able to answer \"yes\" or \n\"no\" to pain in order for his c-spine to be cleared.  For this \nreason, he remains in a collar.  At rehab, once he is able to do \nthis without the collar, the collar may be discontinued.\n\nEndo - Normoglycemia maintained with insulin sliding scale as an \ninpatient.\n\nProphylaxis - pneumoboots, coumadin, bowel regimen, prevacid.\n\nDispo - for discharge to [**Hospital1 **] rehab facility.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCoumadin\nCaptopril\nMetoprolol\nLipitor\nZoloft\nCephalexin \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Coronal and sagittal reformats \nwere also obtained.\n\nCT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are moderate dependent \natelectatic changes. Linear atelectasis is seen at left lung \nbase. There is increased interstitial markings, which, in this \ncase, probably indicate a degree of mild fluid overload. An \nill-defined 1-cm nodule is seen in the anterolateral right upper \nlobe. A small rounded 3-mm pulmonary nodule is seen more \ninferiorly in the right middle lobe. There are shotty \nmediastinal lymph[**MD Number 298**] and a calcified lymph node in the right \nparatracheal region, measuring 13 mm. Other lymph[**MD Number 298**] are not \npathologically enlarged. The aorta is normal in caliber, without \nevidence of dissection. There are coronary vascular \ncalcifications, most notably in the left anterior descending and \ncircumflex arteries. No pericardial effusion is present.\n\nCT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: No intra-abdominal free fluid is \nseen. There is no free air. The liver, spleen, kidneys, \npancreas, and left adrenal all appear to be within normal \nlimits. A tiny 7-mm low-density lesion is seen in the adrenal \ngland, of uncertain significance. The gallbladder is not \nvisualized; the extra-hepatic common bile duct appears \nprominent, measuring approximately 1-cm in diameter. The aorta \nis normal in caliber, with mural calcifications. The major \narteries are patent. There is some atheromatous plaque in the \naorta, but there is no evidence of dissection. In the right \nlower quadrant, there is a 23 x 18 mm soft tissue lesion with a \ncentral calcification. The appendix is not visualized. Please \nnote that this is non- oral contrast scan, and therefore is \nlimited in terms of evaluation of the bowel. The sigmoid \ncontains diverticulosis, without diverticulitis. The bladder \ncontains a Foley with non-dependent air. Distal ureters appear \nunremarkable. Prostate appears slightly enlarged. No free air or \nfree fluid is seen in the pelvis.\n\nThere is a chronic-appearing wedge configuration of T7 and T8, \nwithout evidence of retropulsion of fragments into the spinal \ncanal. There are degenerative changes throughout, with loss of \ndisc height at several levels including L3-4 and L4-5. L5-S1 \nshows mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5. There is a comminuted \nfracture through the right proximal femur.\n\nMultiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings \nabove.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of aortic dissection. Coronary vascular \ncalcifications noted.\n\n2. Proximal right femoral fracture.\n\n3. 2.3 cm soft tissue mass in right lower quadrant with single \nlarge calcification which may represent appendicolith. Followup \nstudy in 3 months recommended to ensure stability.\n\n4.

Swallows were slow \/ delayed.  \nLaryngeal elevation felt adequate to palpation. There was no \ncough, no throat clear and no change in voice quality after \neating or drinking. However, the pt. consistently said that she \nfelt like coughing after drinking water. She said she did not \nfeel like coughing after drinking nectar thick liquids. We were \nunable to obtain a reliable O2 saturation despite trying on her \nfinger, toe or ear. She seemed to swallow ground and pureed \nsolids but did best when she alternated between bites and sips.  \n\nShe could not swallow the whole pill w\/nectar or in applesauce.  \n\nSo, we crushed the pill in custard and swallowed it with a sip \nof \nnectar to follow. \n \nSUMMARY \/ IMPRESSION: \n[**Known patient firstname 2659**] [**Known patient lastname 1275**] may be aspirating thin liquids because she says \nshe feel like coughing consistently after drinking water.  \nHowever, she appears safe to drink nectar thick liquids and to \neat pureed or ground solids if she alternates between bites and \nsips. She could not swallow a whole pill today with nectar thick \n\norange juice or whole in applesauce, but she swallowed her pill \ncrushed in custard w\/a sip of nectar to follow.  \nThis swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome \nSeverity Scale (DOSS) rating of Level 4, Mild to moderate \ndysphagia with 2 consistnecy restrictions and intermittent \nsupervision\/cueing. This dysphagia is likely due to her old \nstrokes. \n \nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n1. Diet of ground solids and Nectar thick liquids with  \nPills crushed in puree \n \n2. Supervision w\/meals \nAlternate between bites and sips \n \n3. If there are further concerns about aspiration on this diet, \nwe would be happy to perform a FEES evaluation. She would \nnot be a candidate for a Videoswallow because she is too \nlarge to fit into the fluoroscope. \n \nThese recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and \nmedical team. \n \n \n____________________________________ \n[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1590**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2660**] [**Doctor Last Name 2661**], M.S., CCC-SLP \nPager # [**Pager number 2662**] \n \n\n \nPertinent Results:\n[**3430-5-18**] 07:23AM BLOOD WBC-10.7 RBC-2.71* Hgb-8.0* Hct-23.9* \nMCV-88 MCH-29.5 MCHC-33.4 RDW-16.5* Plt Ct-311\n[**3430-4-18**] 06:10AM BLOOD Neuts-95.5* Bands-0 Lymphs-1.9* \nMonos-1.3* Eos-1.0 Baso-0.4\n[**3430-4-15**] 07:30PM BLOOD WBC-5.5 RBC-4.54 Hgb-12.1 Hct-37.2 MCV-82 \nMCH-26.7* MCHC-32.5 RDW-14.9 Plt Ct-158\n[**3430-4-15**] 07:30PM BLOOD Neuts-65.6 Lymphs-26.2 Monos-4.7 Eos-3.2 \nBaso-0.3\n[**3430-5-19**] 05:38AM BLOOD PT-16.4* INR(PT)-1.5*\n[**3430-5-18**] 07:23AM BLOOD Plt Ct-311\n[**3430-4-15**] 07:30PM BLOOD Plt Ct-158\n[**3430-4-15**] 07:30PM BLOOD PT-11.4 PTT-26.1 INR(PT)-1.0\n[**3430-5-12**] 03:03AM BLOOD ESR-65*\n[**3430-5-19**] 10:41AM BLOOD Glucose-156* UreaN-25* Creat-1.1 Na-140 \nK-3.7 Cl-109* HCO3-22 AnGap-13\n[**3430-4-15**] 07:30PM BLOOD Glucose-130* UreaN-23* Creat-1.1 Na-142 \nK-3.8 Cl-107 HCO3-24 AnGap-15\n[**3430-5-4**] 11:20PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-188*\n[**3430-4-30**] 04:45AM BLOOD ALT-40 AST-39 LD(LDH)-310* AlkPhos-136* \nAmylase-52 TotBili-0.3\n[**3430-4-30**] 04:45AM BLOOD Lipase-44\n[**3430-5-4**] 11:20PM BLOOD CK-MB-4 cTropnT-0.02*\n[**3430-5-19**] 10:41AM BLOOD Calcium-8.2* Phos-3.7 Mg-2.3\n[**3430-4-15**] 07:30PM BLOOD Calcium-9.1 Phos-3.0 Mg-2.3\n\nRADIOLOGY  Final Report\n\nCHEST (PA & LAT)  [**3430-5-18**] 8:42 AM\n\nCHEST (PA & LAT)\n\nReason: evaluate effusion \n\nUNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:\n64 year old woman with R innom. aneurysm \nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\nevaluate effusion \nPORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, 8:52 A.M., [**5-18**].\n\nINDICATION: Followup effusion.\n\nFINDINGS: Compared with 5\/16 and with [**3430-5-11**], haziness at the \nright lung base is consistent with the right pleural effusion \nseen on CT of 5\/19 and does not appear grossly changed.\n\nThe left hemidiaphragm is elevated compared with the pre-op \nstudy consistent the left lower lobe collapse on CT.

Brought to OSH \nwhere he was febrile to 102 and hypotensive requiring pressors. \nHead CT negative; LP had WBC 14 (N30 L70), RBC 8500, protein 63, \nglucose 64. CT of abdomen demonstrated diffuse bowel process \nwith intussusception; brought to OR at OSH for exlap and \nreduction of intussusception (no perf or gangrenous tissue was \nvisualized). Patinet was treated with Zosyn; Transferred here \nfor further management on [**4-11**].  \nHere he was initially treated by MICU with \nvanc\/cefepime\/levo\/flagyl\/acyclovir. Had negative EEG, CT torso \ndemonstrated pulmonary infiltrates and colon wall thickening. \nSince arrival he appears to have had a postop ileus; no stool \nsamples have been available for requisite stool studies. He \ndefervesced, normalized his blood pressure, and was extubated. \nOn [**4-14**] he was reintubated for bronchoscopy given MICU team \nconcerns about pulmonary infiltrates; he is now on negative \npressure isolation awaiting serial AFB smears. On [**4-15**] he \ndeveloped abdominal distension with an elevated bladder pressure \nand surgery was consulted; repeat CT abdomen\/pelvis not \nparticularly revealing. Over the weekend he has been \nincreasingly distended and developed acute renal failure of \nuncertain etiology. He now has enough ascites for the team to \ntap.  \nIssues to deal with:  \n1. GI process  \n- needs stool for C dif, microsporidia, cryptosporidia, \nisospora, giardia etc  \n- f\/u paracentesis results  \n2. pulmonary infiltrates  \n- f\/u bronchoscopy cultures  \n- AFB smears  \n3. CNS issues; MICU team has asked that HSV PCR be added to OSH \nCSF; awaiting this result though I think that this syndrome is \nnot c\/w HSV.  \n4. Vanc\/levo\/flagyl are all empiric, I guess for pneumonia \ncoverage though I'm not so impressed that this is such an active \nprocess, and bowel coverage, until the reason for abdominal \ndistension gets sorted out, and for C dif.  \n5.

Toward the end of his hospital course, he was \nplaced on on levophed\/vasopressin\/dopamine for HD support. \nhypovolemic as evidenced by low CVPs. Patient becameAnuric. \nCVPs16-17 after boluses of IVF. Lactate trending up \n(10.8)--likely ischemic gut [**1-6**] abd compartment syndrome. \npatient was also placed on stress dosed steroids.  He was \ntreated with antibiotics as above.  CVVHD was also started due \nto the patient's anuria, but was d\/c'd due to hypotension.  \nRepeated boluses of albumin failed to bring up the patient's \nblood pressure so the patient had to remain on pressors for the \nrest of the hospital course prior to withdrawal of care.  \n.\n## Abdominal distension. during the course of his stay, patient \nappeared to develop compartment syndrome of the abdomen. Pt. \nlikely w\/ progressive ascites w\/ some distended bowel. US guided \ntap was attempted but terminated [**1-6**] proximity of the liver to \nthe pocket of ascites. Pt has increased bladder pressures \nsuggestive of compartment syndrome. Surgery consutled decided \nagainst any intervention due to to patient's very morbid \nprognosis.  No futher intervention was made regarding this issue \nuntil the patient expired on [**2985-4-21**].\n\n.\n## Respiratory failure: Pt was originally intubated and remained \nintubated [**1-6**] mental status changes.  Gases were looking fine up \nuntil the end of the hospital course when patient developed \nlactic acidosis. Was extubated and then required reintubation \n[**1-6**] need for bronch given CT findings of upper lobe infiltrates \nconcerning for TB. Has multifocal pna on CT scan and has been \nruled out for TB based on smears. Remains intubated for mental \nstatus as well as resp. failure. BAL was NGTD. Patient was \nterminally extubated when the decision to withdraw care was made \ntogether with the family.\n.\n## ARF: [**1-6**] ATN due to hypoperfusion, ischemia due to current \nabdominal compartment syndrome. ddx includes hepatorenal syn. \nDialysis line was placed and CVVHD was started but stopped soon \nafter due to low blood pressures. FeNa 5% suggesting ATN, going \nagainst hepatorenal or prerenal. r\n.\n## MS changes: Likely [**1-6**] hepatic ddx hypoxic encephalopathy \nfrom hypotension\/ ddx hepatic encephalopathy. With INR 17, \nintracranial hemorrhage is also a possibility. Head CT neg (in \npast). No seizures on EEG per neuro.  Patient's mental status \nfailed to improve during the hospital stay.  Responsible factors \nincluded hypoxic encephalopathy in addition to hepatic \nencephalopathy.\n\n.\n## Hep B cirrhosis\nSevere transaminitis on admission , treding down, with second \npeak recently upon worsening of the abdominal compartment \nsyndrome.  Initial transaminitis likely due to shock liver in \nsetting of hypotension. Now LFTs trending down likely that the \nliver has \"burned out.\" patient odes have distended GB, ? \nacalculous cholecystitis, ? perc chole brought up, but procedure \ntoo risky [**1-6**] cirrhosis and underlying coagulopathy.

Selective coronary angiography in this critically ill \npatient revealed severe three vessel CAD.  The LMCA had a 70% \norigin \nstenosis and a 90% distal stenosis extending into the LAD.  The \nLAD also had a mid 100% occlusion and supplies a one large \nseptal.  The LCX was diffusely disease with a 80% origin \nstenosis and a long 95% mid stenosis. The rest of the vessel was \ndiffusely diseased as well.  The RCA was diffusely diseased with \n70% mid stenosis, 90% PDA stenosis and a 70% posterolateral. \n2.  Initial resting hemodynamics revealed severe cardiogenic \nshock with elevation of right and left sided pressures (RA mean \n26 and PCWP mean 46mmHG).  There was severe pulmonary \nhypertension with mean of 54mmHG. The cardiac index was low at \n1.96 despite pressors.  Initial PH was 7.09 with metabolic and \nrespiratory acidosis.  Initial blood pressure was 100\/80. \n3.  Intra aortic was placed with improvement of augmented \npressures to 121\/53 and cardiac index to 2.91. \n4.  Echo was performed during the case showing EF about 25% with \n\nmoderately severe mitral regurgitation and akinesis in LAD \nterritory. \nThe wall motion was best at the base. \n5.  Urgent surgical consult was obtained and patient was \ndeclined due to poorly amenable anatomy and severe metabolic and \nhemodynamic \nderangements. \n.  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with critical left main \ndisease. \n2. Severe cardiogenic shock. \n.\nECHO [**2726-4-2**]: \nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall \nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is \nmoderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function \nis severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion \nabnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis, \napical akinesis, lateral hypokinesis, and anterior hypokinesis. \nNo apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude. Right ventricular \nchamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is \nborderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly  \nthickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \n.\nCXR [**2726-4-2**]: 1. Endotracheal tube tip 3 cm from the carina.  NG \ntube courses through the stomach. 2. Left upper and lower lobe \nconsolidation\/atelectasis. \n.\nCXR [**2726-4-3**]: The endotracheal tube is at the level of the aortic \nknob and unchanged. Left-sided nasogastric tube, which is below \nthe gastroesophageal junction. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter \nentering from inferior approach.  The distal tip is within the \norigin of the right pulmonary artery and has migrated more \nproximally since the previous study.  The opacity within the \nleft upper lobe is less well seen on today's study.  There \nremains a left retrocardiac opacity \nand subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.  Blunting of \nbilateral \ncostophrenic angles are identified consistent with pleural \neffusions. \n.\nCXR [**2726-4-4**]: The Swan-Ganz catheter entering from a femoral \napproach has been pulled back and the tip is now in the RA.  The \nendotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are appropriate sited and \nunchanged in position.  There remains some cardiomegaly. There \nare bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a left retrocardiac \nopacity. These findings have not changed. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n82 F with PMH hyperchol, HTN with STEMI not amenable to CABG \n([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7012**], LAD), with cardiogenic shock, who eventually passed \naway.\n\n# STEMI and cardiogenic shock:\n(1) Ischemia:\nPatient had significant CAD on cath s\/p DES to LMain, LAD, LCX.  \nDuring cath, results showed 3VD with critical left main disease, \nand severe cardiogenic shock.  Successful placement of an IABP, \nand successful PCI of the LMCA into the LAD were performed.  \nCardiac enzymes were elevated with CK peak 1215, MB 124, Trop \n4.68, but EKG was unchanged.  A balloon pump was placed in the \nCCU for cardiogenic shock, and the balloon pump was successfully \nremoved with good hemodynamic control.  The patient remained \nsedated and intubated, so whether the patient was experiencing \nCP or symptoms could not be assessed.  Patient was maintained on \nASA, plavix, statin.  She was not given BB\/ACE because of \ncardiogenic shock.\n.  \n(2) Pump:\nECHO revealed EF 25% with 3+MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was maintained on dopa \nand IABP in the CCU.  Dopamine was switched to levophed because \nof signs of sepsis, and was gradually weaned off.  Because of \nsigns of sepsis, the IABP and PA catheter were removed, and an \nIJ line was used for CVP monitoring, which was kept around 12.  \nMAP was maintained >65.  UO was maintained at >30cc\/hr.\n.  \n(3) Rhythm:  \nIn the cath lab, the patient had 1 episode of VTach x 1 minute, \nand was loaded with amio and lido, and the patient did not \nrequire DCCV.  The patient was in NSR for the remainder of \nadmission with no events on tele.\n.  \n#. Resp Failure:  \nPt was intubated at OSH for resp failure, presumed [**3-11**] to CHF \nand 3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] maintained good oxygenation and ventilation, \npatient had a difficult time being weaned from the vent.  \nSwan-Ganz was placed in the CCU for monitoring.\n.  \n#. Heme: \nHct decreased from baseline of 30 to 28 -> 24 -> 28, and \nreceived several units RBC to maintain Hct >28. Platelets were \nstable at around 100.  On smear were monocyte blasts and NRBC, \nand MDS was considered.  Patient was HIT negative, DIC and \nhemolysis labs were negative.  \n.  \n#. ARF: \nBaseline Cr for patient was 1.1, and Cr was up to 1.4.  Etiology \nwas likely multifactorial, due to prerenal state, ATN and \ncontrast nephropathy contributing.  \n.  \n#. ID:\nPatient had signs of sepsis in the CCU, with temp spikes, low \nSVR, and hyperdynamic CO\/CI.  Patient was on levophed, which was \ndifficult to wean.  Patient was given antibiotics including \nCeftriaxone, Levo, Vanco, Flagyl.  Sputum culture was negative, \nbut showed 3+ GPC.  Source of sepsis was not found, and IABP and \nPA catheter were appropriately removed.\n.  \n#. Hypothyroidism:\nStable at baseline.  Patient was not given synthroid inhouse \nbecause of ventricular arrhythmia early during admission.\n.  \n# Death:\nOn [**2726-4-8**] at 8 PM, the patient's HCP, son [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known patient lastname 13305**], and \nhis sister, wished to make the patient CMO and withdraw care.  \nThis was discussed with the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 218**]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 850**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], \nwho spoke with the family regarding withdrawal of care.

She went to\nthe Catheterization Laboratory for an attempt to try to cross\nthe right coronary artery stenosis, no balloon was able to be\ndelivered.  Stents could not be delivered also.  The vessel\nappeared to be distally dissected distal to the stent.\nCardiothoracic Surgery was called for emergent coronary\nartery bypass graft.  The patient was then referred\nemergently to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 393**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery.\n\nPre-catheterization laboratory data as follows:  Hemoglobin\n13.1, hematocrit 39.3, platelets 211,000, INR 0.98, potassium\n4.6, BUN 26, creatinine 1.0.  The patient was seen also by\nDr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1277**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery emergently, given\nher dissection and need for coronary artery bypass grafting\nin the Catheterization Laboratory.  Her ejection fraction\nalso was noted to be approximately 59 percent.  She had no\nleft anterior descending coronary artery or left main\ndisease.  Medical history is as previously noted.\n\nOn examination her lungs were clear bilaterally.  Her heart\nwas regular rate and rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft, obese,\nnontender and nondistended.  She had a well healed incision\non her feet without any erythema.  No cyanosis, clubbing or\nedema.  She had left femoral artery and femoral vein cath\nsheaths in place and no noted varicosities.  She had 2 plus\nbilateral pulses, carotid, radial, femoral, popliteal and no\ndorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses palpable.\n\nThe patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room and\nwas seen also by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 393**] in the Catheterization\nLaboratory.  The patient had been given Plavix, aspirin and\nReopro in the Catheterization Laboratory due to the\ndissection, and the patient underwent emergency coronary\nartery bypass grafting times two with vein graft to the\nobtuse marginal and a vein graft to the right coronary artery\nby Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 393**].  The patient was transferred to Cardiothoracic\nIntensive Care Unit in stable condition on a Propofol drip at\n20 mcg\/kg\/day, a protinin drip at 25 and insulin drip at 2\nunits\/hour.  The patient was extubated on [**11-12**], and\nwas doing well, she was hemodynamically stable.  She was also\nseen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1153**] of Cardiology and also seen by Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 393**].  On postoperative day Number 2, white count was 9.3,\nhematocrit 24.4, platelet count 113,000, BUN 20, creatinine\n1.4.  The patient was on a Lasix drip and a nitroglycerin\ndrip at 1.0 as well as insulin drip.  The patient was also\nstarted on oral aspirin and Lopressor beta blockade and\ncontinued with perioperative Vancomycin.  She was\nhemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130\/45 and\nheart rate in sinus rhythm at 75.  The patient continued to\ndo well throughout the day with a plan to try to discontinue\nthe chest tubes at the end of the day and the following day\nthe patient was transferred out to the floor and continued to\ndo very well and was instructed and encouraged to use her\nincentive spirometer.  She denied any symptoms.  Chest tubes\nwere removed in the afternoon.\n\nThe patient was seen by Case Management.  She was alert and\noriented times three and slept well over night on the floor.\nShe was also encouraged to increase her ambulation and was\nseen and evaluated by physical therapy who continued to work\nwith her.  On postoperative day Number 3, her lungs were\nclear bilaterally.  She was alert and oriented.  Her heart\nwas regular rate and rhythm.  She had 1 plus peripheral\nedema.  Her incisions were clean, dry and intact.  Her chest\ntubes were out.  Her central venous line was out and her\nepicardial pacing wires remained in place.  Her creatinine\nrose slightly to 1.5.  Her Metformin was held, but glyburide\nwas being given as her blood sugar was greater than 220.  She\nwas also on sliding scale insulin at that point and started\non NPH every day to help manage her blood sugars again.\n\nOn [**10-16**], her creatinine rose again slightly to 1.6.\nShe had no complaints of pain and was just taking p.o.\nTylenol.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued.  On\npostoperative day Number 4, her blood sugar improved with\ninsulin with a morning blood sugar of 108, white count 11.1.\nCreatinine came down to 1.2.  The patient continued on beta\nblockade with Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., and had also been\nstarted back on the Norvasc and continued with Lasix\ndiuresis.  She did have a brief sinus arrhythmia but heart\nwas otherwise regular rate and rhythm.  She was doing very\nwell.  Lopressor was decreased later in the day to 25 b.i.d.\nand [**Hospital1 39**] consult was requested for management of her blood\nsugars.  The patient was also seen again by Case Management\nand continued to work with physical therapy to improve her\nphysical level of activity and her pulmonary toilet.\n\nDischarge teaching was begun with the patient on\npostoperative day Number 5.  She continued to do very well\nwith blood pressure 160\/48 in sinus rhythm at 64.  Creatinine\ncame down to 1.1.  She was sating 94 percent on room air and\ncontinued to do well.  Glucophage was restarted and PEH was\ndiscontinued.  Plavix and Avapro were restarted as well.  The\npatient continued to do very well and did Level 4 on [**10-17**] with physical therapy, and continued to improve.  She was\nambulating independently with a steady gait as she has had\nsome lower extremity edema but she was encouraged to elevate\nher legs while sitting or in her recliner while at home and\nshe was discharged to home with Visiting Nurse Association\nservices on [**10-18**] in stable condition with the\nfollowing discharge diagnoses.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post emergent coronary artery\nbypass grafting times two.\n\nHypertension.\n\nHyperlipidemia.\n\nNoninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\nDiabetic peripheral bilateral foot neuropathy.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

Inferior ST elevations \nII > III, with insignificant Qs in inf-lateral leads. No prior \navailable for comparison. EKG post-cath reveals SR at 70, with \nno appreciable change in ST elevations. RBBB still present.  \n.  \nCARDIAC CATH performed on [**3328-5-18**] demonstrated:  \nLMCA--no sign disease  \nLAD--Diffuse calcific disease, serial 50% lesion and mid vessel \n80% lesion  \nLCX--TO distally with LPDA filling via RCA collaterals. Mid \nvessel 80% lesion proximal vessel 60% lesion  \nRCA--Diffuse disease with serial 60% lesions (small vessel)  \nPCI--Overlapping stents in distal OM with normal flow, mild \nthrombus, and no residual stenosis, absent collateral flow  \n.\nCardiac cath performed on [**3328-5-20**] demonstrated:\nPCI--Ovelapping stents in diagonal branch 1. \n.\nConclusions:  \nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal \n(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall \nmotion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right \nventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall \nhypokinesis.  The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally \nnormal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve \nstenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve \nleaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation \nis seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely \nrepresents a fat pad.  \nIMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with basal \nhypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension \nsuggestive of primary pulmonary process (pulmonary embolism, \nCOPD, etc.) though cannot exclude RV ischemia\/myopathy.  Mild \nmitral regurgitation.  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a 78 year old man with no previously known coronary \nartery disease who presented with chest pain.  \n.  \n1. Coronary artery disease: The patient had inferior ST-segmenet \nelevations on his admission EKG, but two cardiac \ncatheterizations did not demonstate lesions consistent with this \ndistribution.  The patient's peak CK and troponin were 57 and \n0.06 respectively.  There were no events on telemetry.  The \npatient did however have extensive evidence of disease on \ncatheterization.  Multiple balloon inflations and deployment of \n4 stents were performed: two to the OM1 branch of the LAD, and \ntwo to the D1 branch of the LCx.  The limited flow with no \napparent decrease in ST-segment elevation on EKG and continued \npain were all consistent with likely distal embolisation.  the \npatient was briefly maintained on a nitroglycerine drip, \nintegrillin drip and IV lopressor.  The patient was ultimately \ntransitioned back to PO lopressor and lipitor.  Aspirin and \nplavix were added.  ECHO demonstrated preserved cardiac \nfunction.     \n.  \n2. HISTORY OF DVT\/PE: History of DVT while on coumadin. Will \ncontinue heparin as above, plan on transition to lovenox once \nclinically stable.  \n.  \n3.

He was referred\nby his primary care doctor to the [**Hospital1 **] Liver\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  The patient has had surgery in the past for a question of\nsome type of hepatic adenoma.\n2.  Migraines.\n3.  Hypertension.\n4.  Hypothyroidism.\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n1.  Zestril.\n2.  Topamax.\n3.  Levoxyl.\n4.  Nadolol.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a mother who had colon\ncancer at the age of 49.\n\nLABORATORY:  After being seen in the Liver Clinic, the\npatient had a CT scan with contrast of his abdomen and\npelvis.  An obvious 20 centimeters hypervascular mass\noccupying the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is\npresent on the CT scan.  This mass appeared to be compressing\nthe portal vein, inferior vena cava and hepatic artery,\nalthough there was no definite evidence of vascular invasion.\n\nThere was also a large right pleural effusion seen on the\nscan.\n\nTo further clarify the characteristics of the tumor, an MRI\nwas scheduled for [**4-30**].  This MRI showed that this mass\nhad significant mass effect upon the inferior vena cava.  The\ninferior vena cava is displaced right to left across the\nmidline from the mass, which again does not show invasive\nfeatures.\n\nThe patient also underwent preoperative laboratory studies.\nPreoperatively, the patient's white blood cell count is 7.3,\nhematocrit 32.5, platelets 157, creatinine 1.2, ALT 41, AST\n79, alkaline phosphatase 227, total bilirubin 6.9, amylase\n28, lipase 81; INR 1.4.  CEA 1.4.  AST 1.2.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**3135-5-7**], the patient thus\nunderwent a caudate lobectomy of the liver.  Please see the\nOperative Note for further details.  Towards the end of the\noperation, the patient was somewhat coagulopathic as he had\nreceived several units of blood products, including at least\n35 units of packed red blood cells.  Towards the end of the\nprocedure, he had a platelet count of 55,000 and an INR of\n2.9.  There was oozing of blood from the liver bed.  Attempts\nto control this blood with Argon beam, topical thrombin,\nBio-Glue, Serpasil, Gelfoam with thrombin were all\nunsuccessful.\n\nTherefore, the liver bed was packed with laparotomy pads.\nThe decision was made at this time in the Operating Room to\npack the patient and return at 48 hours for removal of the\npacks.  The abdomen was closed using running #1-0 PDS for the\nlinear [**Female First Name (un) 4815**]; two [**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] drains were left; one superior\nto the liver and one inferior to the liver.\n\nThe patient then had an extended stay in the Intensive Care\nUnit.  He was intubated for several days.  He required blood\npressure support with Levophed for [**5-6**], [**5-7**], and\n[**5-8**].  The Levophed was discontinued on [**5-9**].  He\nrequired intubation for several days.  He was taken back to\nthe Operating Room on [**5-9**], at which time the laparotomy\npads were removed from his abdomen.  He was then closed\nprimarily and was extubated on [**5-13**], successfully.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the Floor on [**5-14**].  On\n[**5-15**], the patient was started on p.o. intake.  He began\nto spike fevers frequently, up to 101.9\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdF.  At this time, he\nhad several cultures sent.  He has three open areas in his\nChevron incision.  Each of those wounds was swabbed and sent\nfor Gram stain and culture.  Both [**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] drains were\ncultured.  Blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum culture\nwere also sent.  He had several cultures resent over the next\nseveral days for recurrence of fevers.\n\nOne of the [**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] drains at one point in time grew out\nStaphylococcus coagulase negative; this was the only\nsignificant finding and was only seen in one sample on one\noccasion.  Infectious Disease was involved and he was started\non Vancomycin and Imipenem on [**5-14**].  He went on to\ncomplete a 14-day course of Imipenem and Vancomycin and then\nthese were discontinued on [**5-28**].\n\nThe patient continued to have fevers, so a CT scan was\nordered on [**5-18**].  The CT scan revealed no abscess,\nhowever, did reveal a clot in the inferior vena cava; thus,\nthe patient was started on a heparin drip.  This inferior\nvena cava clot was probably contributing to the tremendous\namount of fluids he had in his lower extremities and he was\nbeing diuresed every day with Lasix.  The patient was started\non Coumadin on [**5-21**], in an attempt to be able to\nanti-coagulate him with oral medication.  Of significance,\none of his [**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] drains was discontinued on [**5-17**],\nand the second one was discontinued on [**5-19**].  He had a\nconsiderable amount of seepage from the [**Location (un) 1275**]-[**Location (un) **] sites.\nThese were stitched and there was still a considerable amount\nof seepage.  They were re-stitched more securely on [**5-27**],\nand then there was very little seepage.\n\nThe patient was kept in-house until [**5-28**], to complete a\n14-day course of Vancomycin and Imipenem.\n\nThe pathology from his operation came back hepatic-cellular\ncarcinoma, well differentiated, with extensive necrosis.\nThere is invasion of the attached fibrous tissue structure\nand no normal liver tissue was seen.\n\nThe patient's INR came up to 1.9 on discharge date of [**5-28**] and the patient was tolerating a regular diet and stable\nfor discharge to home with Visiting Nurses Association care.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n1.

Clinical \ncorrelation is recommended.\n.\nECHO: Conclusions:  \nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or  \ncolor Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with  \nnormal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional \nleft ventricular  \nwall motion appears normal (in some views the inferior wall \nappears  \nhypokinetic but this may be due to frequent ectopy\/irregular \nrhythm). Right  \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic root is  \nmildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve  \nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \npresent. No  \nmasses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic \nregurgitation  \nis seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired \nrelaxation.  \nTransmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent \nwith Grade I  \n(mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The estimated \npulmonary artery  \nsystolic pressure is normal. No vegetation\/mass is seen on the \npulmonic valve.  \nThere is no pericardial effusion.  \n  \nIMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. \n.\nMR L spine [**7-12**]: FINDINGS: No comparisons are available.\n.\nThere is large area of destruction involving the L1\/2 disc with \ndestructive end plate changes of L1 and L2. There is \nheterogeneously increased T2 signal as well as diffuse \nenhancement of these vertebral bodies and disc, consistent with \nspondylitic discitis. There is paraspinal and epidural phlegmon \nwithout a discrete abscess.\n\nAt T12\/L1, there is a left lateral disc bulge extending from the \nforamen to the extraforaminal region. There is no significant \ncentral canal or neural foraminal narrowing at this level.\n\nNote is made of a 1 cm gallstone.\n\nIMPRESSION: L1\/2 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural \nphlegmon without a discrete abscess. The epidural phlegmon is \ncausing 25-50% central canal narrowing\n.\nLeft venous upper extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Intraluminal \nthrombus within the left IJ vein. The remainder of the right \nupper extremity veins are patent. There is a small soft tissue \nfluid collection adjacent to the left shoulder, which may \nrepresent a small post-procedure hematoma\n.\nCT chest [**7-15**]: IMPRESSION:\n1. Osseous destruction at L1-2 with paravertebral soft tissue \nconsistent with osteomyelitis\/discitis, better demonstrated on \nrecent MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**3268-7-12**]. Evaluation of the central canal is \nlimited on CT.\n\n2. Bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, \nlikely representing pulmonary edema, although superimposed \npneumonia is not excluded.\n\n3. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.\n\n4. Gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis.\n\n5. Absent bilateral native kidneys and atrophic-appearing \ntransplant kidney, right pelvis.\n.\nCXR [**7-17**]: There has been a substantial increase in perihilar \npulmonary consolidation which is seen on the lateral view to lie \nin the upper and middle lobes, less so in the lower. In \naddition, there are discretely nodular opacities seen in the \nlower lungs particularly on the right, all of which points to \ndisseminated infection, alternatively progressive pulmonary \nhemorrhage, rather than pulmonary edema as suggested previously. \nMild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there is no \nappreciable pleural effusion. There has been interval increase \nin thickness of the right paratracheal and mediastinal soft \ntissue probably combination of azygos vein distention, \nmediastinal fat deposition, and some increase in central \nadenopathy. Left supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis catheter \nhas been advanced to the lower third of the SVC. There is no \npneumothorax\n.\nCT chest: IMPRESSION: Worsening multilobar pneumonia, much less \nlikely pulmonary hemorrhage.\n.\nBone scan: IMPRESSION: \n1. Abnormal focal osseous uptake along the right aspect of the \nL1 and L2\nvertebral bodies which may represent osteomyelitis, though \nnon-specific. This\nwill be correlated to the results of the white blood cell scan \nwhen available. \n2. Marked diffuse cardiac uptake, which could be consistent \ncardiac\namyloidosis. \n.\nWBC scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Pneumonia 2. No convincing evidence for \nspinal osteomyelitis although In-111 white blood cells may have \nsome decrease in sensitiviy in the spine. \n.\nMr of right shoulder: IMPRESSION:\n1. Extremely limited examination. The patient could not complete \nthe study and the submitted images are degraded by significant \nmotion artifact. There is a loculated high T2 signal collection \nanterior to the scapula extending anterior to the shoulder. \nSeveral round low signal lesions are present in this collection. \nFindings are nonspecific but most likely represent severe \nglenohumeral degenerative changes with an effusion containing \ndegenerative loose bodies. Further evaluation could be made with \neither a dedicated CT through the shoulder or if the patient \nclinically stabilizes, an attempt at a repeat MR with more time \nsensitive sequences. Correlation with plain x- rays is \nsuggested.\n2.

Patient had \nrecently finished a three week course of vancomycin from \npresumed bacteremia from AV fistula, but per [**Hospital3 2255**], \nall blood cultures sent were negative.  During that hospital \ncourse at [**Hospital3 2255**] he had a temporary HD catheter placed. \n On admission, it was thought initially that the patient had a \nHD catheter infection.  The patient was maintained on vancomycin \nhad his catheter replaced and the tip sent for culture.  During \nhospital course, the patient continued to have fever spikes.  \nAll blood cultures and catheter tip culture returned negative\/no \ngrowth to date.  Therefore infectious disease was consulted \nregarding fever of unknown origin.  Infectious disease, \nrecommended removal of HD catheter x 48 hours (after it was \nalready changed on admission, given continued fever spikes), but \npatient refused.\n.\nPatient also had a known history of discitis and osteomyelitis \nof L1-L2\/epidural abscess in 03\/06.  After evaluation at [**Hospital 2257**] he was evaluated for this problem again at [**Hospital1 717**] in \n[**3268-4-30**].  He has had CT guided biopsies of this area in the \npast, from which the cultures have been negative.  A new MR of \nspine was obtained during his hospital course that demonstrated \ncontinued L1\/2 spondylodiscitis with paraspinal and epidural \nphlegmon without a discrete abscess.  Another CT guided biopsy \nwas considered, and therefore the orthopedic spine team was \nconsulted.  They felt once all other infectious etiologies were \nruled out, we could consider an incision and drainage of the \nphlegmon and\/or a debridement.   \n.\nOther infectious work up during hospital course included a \ntrans-thoracic echocardiogram which was negative for valvular \nvegetations, ultrasound of chest wall (where HD catheter was) \nwhich was negative for absess, ultrasound of left upper \nextremity deep veins that demonstrated DVT in left IJ, initial \nCT thorax that did not demonstrate any absesses, but revealed \nbilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, which \nlikely represent fluid overload (although are considering other \netiologies on differential), bone scan, WBC scan (revealing \npneumonia), bronchoscopy, and an MR of the shoulder (possible \neffusion noted).  \n.\nA repeat CXR was performed later in his course, which raised the \npossibility of disseminated infection or septic emboli.  This \nled to a pulmonary consult, and per their suggestions, we \nrechecked his Chest CT after dialysis, sent sputum samples and \nsent out an anti-GBM antibody. Later in his course, the CT of \nthe chest and the white cell scan revealed a multilobar \npneumonia, so a bronchoscopy was performed.  As the patient's \nfever curve worsened, while waiting for bronchoscopy results, he \nwas empirically started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl.  \nWith these antibiotics on board, the patient had an episode of \nhypotension.  This, with his fever and tachycardia was worrisome \nfor sepsis, so he was transferred to the ICU for fluid \nresuscitation.  \n.\nInitially per infectious disease, patient was maintained on \nvancomycin, but was not broadened as to not mask etiology of \ninfection. Later in his course all antibiotics were stopped such \nthat the patient's fever curve and cultures could be followed \noff antibiotics.  Eventually with a source of pneumonia, and the \npatient having increased fevers, it was decided the patient \nneeded to be covered and was started on broad spectrum \nantibiotics while cultures were pending. \n.\n2) Atrial fibrillation:  In the ICU, the patient converted into \natrial fibrillation with a rate of 140-150 following \nhemodialysis.  The patient denies atrial fibrillation in the \npast, but this could be related to the stress of infection.  In \nthe ICU, he was started on metoprolol, and converted back to \nnormal sinus rhythm.  The patient remained on telemetry, and was \nonly noted to have ventricular bigeminy. He was maintained on \nmetoprolol throughout hospital course.  Initially, \nanticoagulation was held due to possible coumadin allergy.  Then \npatient was noted to not have this allergy, and started on \nheparin.  Deferred initiation of coumadin to outpatient setting \n(as patient was only in atrial fibrillation for short time \nperiod).   The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm \nthroughout remainder of hospital course.\n. \n3) Hyperkalemia: His hyperkalemia resolved status post dialysis, \nkayexylate, calcium\/bicarb and insulin.  His EKG improved \npost-intervention and we continued to monitor for re-occurrance. \n His hyperkalemia on admission was attributed to the fact that \nhe had recently missed dialysis and that his dialysis catheter \nwas not functioning properly.  Patient's potassium level \nremained stable throughout remainder of hospital course.\n.  \n4) Left Internal Jugular Vein clot: The patient was noted to \nhave a clot of Left internal jugular vein on ultrasound. There \nwas a questionable allergy to coumadin noted in the chart, so \nwhile this was being confirmed, anticoagulation was postponed.  \nWe felt that the patient's allergy to coumadin was unlikely \n(after further investigation) and therefore started a heparin \ndrip.  He should start coumadin as well in the future prior to \nhospital discharge.  He will likely need only 1 month of \nanticoagulation for left IJ DVT.\n.\n5) ESRD: Patient was continued on hemodialysis, three days per \nweek (MWF) and was followed by nephrology.  He did well with \nnephrocaps, renal diet, and hemodialysis. \n.  \n6) Hypertension: Patient's blood pressures remained controlled \non metoprolol, and the dose was adjusted for optimal control.  \nWe did not restart hydralazine as the patient's blood pressures \nwere normal, and we were unsure if this was needed (he is on \nhydralazine and not isosorbide at home, so less renal benefits). \n\n.  \n7) adrenal insufficiency:  We continued his prednisone, and he \ndid not require any stress doses.  \n.  \n8) Hypothyroidism: We continued his home dose of levoxyl.  Based \non the thyroid studies, he can go up on his dose, but he is \nclinically euthyroid so this can be adjusted as an outpatient.  \n.  \n9) Diabetes: We continued to increase his sliding scale insulin, \nuntil he maintained good blood glucose control.\n  \n\nMICU course [**Date range (1) 2258**]: Pt arrived to the MICU with a bp in the \n80s-90s.  He refused central line placement, so his HD catheter \nwas used for central access.  He received a one liter fluid \nbolus and his bp remained stable in the 120s for the rest of his \nMICU stay.  He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics \n(vanc, flagyl, ceftaz -- due to cefepime allergy, and \nlevofloxacin) per ID recommendations.  His steroids were \nincreased to prednisone 40 mg given hx adrenal insufficiency.  \nHe remained afebrile.  His cultures remained negative, and he \nwas transferred back to the floor on [**7-27**].\n\nOn the Floor - The medicine team was called to the ICU to admit \nthe patient to floor.  The patient at that time decided with his \nfamily to discontinue further aggressive medical care, and be \nmade comfort measures only.  The implications of this desicion \nwere discussed at length, and it was made clear that it woudl \nlikely result in his death. He understood the implications, and \ndespite the slim chance that continued aggressive treatment \nmight have resulted in significantly prolonging his life, he \nwished to be made Comfort Measures Only.  The decision was \ndiscussed with his wife, who was supportive. He passed away on \nthe floor shortly after.  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n* recently finished course of Vanc on [**7-4**]  \n* metoprolol 100mg bid  \n* MVI  \n* Zolpidem prn  \n* tylenol prn  \n* Nephrocaps  \n* ASA 81mg qd  \n* Nexium 40mg qd  \n* Lidoderm patch  \n* prednisone 10mg qd  \n* Levoxyl 75mcg qd  \n* colace 100mg bid  \n* hydralazine 10mg qd  \n* RISS  \n* Soriatane 10mg qd  \n \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\nexpired\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n \nFacility:\n[**Hospital6 77**] for the Aged - MACU\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nexpired\n \nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nexpired\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nexpired\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2259**] MD [**MD Number 2260**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2261**] MD [**MD Number 2262**] [**3268-8-15**] @ 1654\nSigned electronically by: DR.

Compared to the previous tracing of \n[**3146-6-17**] the rate is normal. \n.\n[**7-2**] Embolization:\nIMPRESSION: Vascular mass at the gastric antrum and proximal \nduodenum level supplied by the GDA. The GDA was embolized with \ncoils and Gelfoam slurry. No active extravasation of contrast \nwas seen.\n.\n[**7-4**] MRI\nMRI OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of acute brain ischemia \nor intracranial hemorrhage. No structural, signal, or \nenhancement abnormalities are noted within the brain parenchyma. \nApparent signal and enhancement abnormality in the inferior \nfrontal lobes bilaterally are most consistent with artifact from \nthe adjacent cribriform plates. Calcification in the choroid \nplexus as well as choroidal vasculature is noted bilaterally. \nThere is no hydrocephalus. The craniocervical junction is \nnormal. There is thickening of multiple ethmoid air cells. No \nfluid is noted within the mastoid air cells or other paranasal \nsinuses.\n\nMRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilation, \nsignificant stenosis, or arteriovenous malformation.\n\nIMPRESSION: No definite signal or enhancement abnormalities \nwithin the brain parenchyma are definitely seen. The preliminary \nread suggested some abnormalities thought to be within the \nmedial temporal lobes and within the gyri recti of the frontal \nlobes; the former is thought to represent choroid plexus \nvasculature and the latter artifact arising from adjacent \ncribriform plates, a common finding when a 3T scanner is used.\n.\n[**7-4**] CXR\nCHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**3146-6-17**]. Low lung volumes \nmay accentuate vascular structures. No pleural effusion or \npneumothorax. Probable minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the \nleft lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right PICC \nis seen at the proximal portion of the SVC. Embolization coils \nin the epigastric region are noted.\n\nIMPRESSION: Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung \nbase.\n.\n[**7-4**] CT Head\nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, shift of normally \nmidline structures, or infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter \ndifferentiation is preserved. There is no hydrocephalus. Small \nhypodensities in bilateral thalami may be old lacunes and were \npresent on head CT, [**3146-3-6**]. The visualized paranasal sinuses \nand mastoid air cells are clear.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. Again, \nplease note that non-contrast head CT is relatively insensitive \nfor detection of metastatic disease and contrast-enhanced MRI is \nrecommended if this is a clinical concern.\n.\n[**7-4**] EEG\nIMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the mildly slow and disorganized \n\nbackground. This suggests an encephalopathy. No areas of \nprominent \nfocal slowing were evident, and there were no epileptiform \nfeatures. \n.\n[**7-7**] RUE U\/S\nFINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler sonograms of the right internal \njugular, subclavian, axillary, and right brachial veins \ndemonstrate normal compressibility and waveforms. Examination of \nthe contralateral internal jugular vein and subclavian vein also \ndemonstrates normal waveforms and compressibility. The right \ncephalic vein is not imaged on this examination and likely \nremains clotted. A central venous line is observed coursing \nthrough the right brachial veins and is unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right \ninternal jugular, subclavian, or axillary veins. No findings \nconsistent with SVC syndrome.\n.\n[**7-8**] MRV\nLower portions of both the right and left internal jugular veins \nare widely patent, as are both the right and left \nbrachiocephalic veins. The SVC is patent as well. There is mild \nnarrowing of the SVC in its mid portion, although it is \ndifficult to determine whether this represents a nondistended \nstate or a functional stenosis\/stricture.\n\nThe left subclavian vein appears patent along its entire course.\n\nRight subclavian vein is non-visualized for a segment of \napproximately 1-2 cm lateral to the the lung apex, presumably \nsecondary to prior stenosis\/thrombus. More proximally and \ndistally, flow is seen within this vessel.\n\nSmall bilateral pleural effusions are present. A mass is seen \nwithin the left lobe of the liver on the coronal SSFSE images.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of SVC conclusion. Mild narrowing may be present \nin the mid portion of the SVC, although we cannot assess whether \nthis is truly anatomic stenosis or simply physiogical due to \nnondistension.\n2. Short segment of partial obstruction versus stenosis in the \ncentral portion of the right subclavian vein.\n3. Patent appearance of the visualized portions of both the \nright and left internal jugular veins as well as the \nbrachiocephalic veins.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nAssessment\/Plan: 72 year old man with a past medical history \nsignificant for metastatic gastric cancer, thrombotic events, \nand MSSA bacteremia who was recently discharged to a nursing \nhome on lovenox, admitted with 4d of dark, guiaiac positive \nstools and 12 point Hct drop, now s\/p ICU stay with 4 [**Location 1424**] \ntransfusion and unsuccessfull EGD with epinephrine injection \ninto bleeding gastric mass and subsequently embolization.  \n.  \n#) GI bleed:  \nKnown gastric cancer with hypercoaguable state. Placed on \nlovenox upon discharge on [**6-24**]. Hematocrit noted to have \ndecreased from 36.8 on [**6-26**] to 23.8 on admission. Dark stools \nover the four days PTA. Guaiac positive in ED. Hct continued to \ntrend down and he was transfused several units of PRBCS. He \nunderwent an EGD that showed a large gastric mass with central \nulceration and recent bleeding. His hct continued to trend down \nthereafter, and he was therefore transferred to Angiography for \nembolization therapy, which he received on [**3146-7-2**]. His hct has \nbeen stable since that procedure.  \n.  \n#) Prior MSSA infection:  \nBlood cultures on [**6-17**] grew MSSA in 4\/4 bottles. Urinalysis \nand chest xray negative. TTE negative for vegetations and TEE \ndeferred.  \nGiven his prior history of deep vein thrombosis, upper extremity \nultrasounds were obtained and notable for bilateral cephalic \nvein DVTs. Surveillance for infected clots negative. PICC line \nwas placed on [**3146-6-21**] for antibiotic administration. Will need \nto continue Nafcillin for four weeks (high dose at 2 gm IV every \n4 hours), day 1 [**3146-6-21**], with last doses on [**3146-7-18**]. Scheduled \nto follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 338**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 339**] in the [**Hospital **] clinic on [**7-22**] \nat 0900 AM.  \n.  \n#) Hypercoagulability:  \nExtensive personal and presumed family history of thromboses, \nwith port-associated thrombus requiring port removal with \nplacement of a new left-sided port in [**3146-2-21**], followed by \nSVC thrombus requiring TPA in [**3146-4-21**]. On previous admission \nin [**3146-6-21**], upper extremity ultrasounds were obtained that \nwere notable for bilateral upper extremity cephalic vein DVTs. \nHis INR was therapeutic on admission, but in late April, \nsubtherapuetic for short period. Placed on lovenox, as deemed \n\"coumadin failure\". Megace was discontinued during last \nadmission due to its potential prothrombotic characteristics. At \ncontinuned high risk for thromboses. In setting of GI bleed, \nheld lovenox and will continue to hold for now per his \noncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 615**]..  \n.  \n#) Metastatic gastric cancer:  \nFollowed by nurse [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11927**]. Primary oncologist Dr. [**Name (STitle) 11928**]. On previous hospitalization in May-[**3146-6-21**], noted to be \nguaiac positive and required one unit of packed red blood cells. \n \n.  \n#) Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr on admission noted to be 1.6. \n He had been down to 1.1 on prior admission but has been as high \nas 1.8 in the past.  His creatinine did not change with IVF and \nno renal abnormalities were found on renal ultrasound.\n- renally dose all medications\n.\n#) Mental status change: He was noted to be acutely disoriented \nthe night after he was transferred from the ICU.  No obvious \ncause was found for his disorientation and his mental status \ncleared over the next 24 hours.  With neurology consulting, he \nwas started empirically on keppra for seizure prevention as his \npresentation was most consistent with a post-ictal state \nalthough EEG did not show seizure activity.  He will follow-up \nwith Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11929**] as an outpatient.  No structural cause for \nseizure was found on MRI.\n.\n#) Diarrhea: he was noted to have increasing diarrhea around the \ntime that he had mental status change.  He was negative X 3 for \nc.diff but as he had been on long-term antibiotics and had \nlow-grade fevers\/inc WBC count, he was started empirically on \nflagyl for a 7 day course and his diarrhea and fevers resolved.\n- we started him on potassium supplementation on discharge as he \nhas been relatively hypokalemic.  His serum chemistries should \nbe checked approximately every other day until stable and \ncontinued on potassium supplementation until his potassium is \nstable.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n-Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H PRN  \n-Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet PO qd  \n-Nafcillin in D2.4W 2 g\/100 mL; 2 grams IV Q4H for 24 days (last \ndose [**3146-7-18**])  \n-Baclofen 10 mg PO tid  \n-Docusate Sodium 100 mg BID PRN  \n-Enoxaparin 60 mg\/0.6 mL Syringe; Sixty mg SC q12hr  \n-Prochlorperazine 10 mg PO q8hr PRN nausea  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He was treated with vancomycin \nand Zosyn for empiric coverage.  He was given supplemental \noxygen via a face tent with standing nebulizer treatments.  In \nspite of his NPO status, he was having frequent episodes of \nintermittent hypoxia requiring suctioning of thick, tenacious \nsecretions.  This, in addition to serial CXRs revealed that he \nwas clearly aspirating his secretions on a continuous basis in \nspite of his NPO status.  Due to this as well as his baseline \ndementia, it was thought that putting in a PEG tube for \nnutrition would not solve the problem of aspiration since he was \nclearly unable to manage his own secretions.  Furthermore, it \nwas clear that he would need constant restraints to avoid \ntraumatic removal of a PEG, which was thought to be an \nunacceptable impairment in his quality of life.  In the setting \nof all of these issues and his severe, acute, worsening \naspiration pneumonia, he was made comfort-measures-only by his \nfamily and legal guardian; he was put on a morphine drip to help \nwith his obvious discomfort, and he expired shortly thereafter.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nFamotidine 20 mg PO BID  \nHexavitamin Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \nCalcium Carbonate 500 mg Tablet,(2) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY  \nCholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 400 unit Tablet Daily).  \nHaldol 1 BID  \nAcetaminophen 325 mg (2) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed \nfor pain.  \ncelexa 10  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nAspiration pneumonia\nDown's syndrome\nAlzheimer's dementia\n \nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nn\/a\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nn\/a\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3929**] MD [**MD Number 3930**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3755**] [**Name8 (MD) 3756**] MD [**MD Number 3757**] [**3150-6-6**] @ 1632\nSigned electronically by: DR.

BMT moonlighter was notified of \nstatus around 8pm, (VS p 90s SBP 90s O2 low 90s on 6-7 L o2) who \nfelt she was wet on exam and she was given 40 IV lasix with some \neffect in terms of urine outpt, but her respiratory status \ncontinued to deteriorate and ABG was hypoxic 7\/43\/40s\/60s, CXR \nw\/ diffuse pulmonary infiltrate. lasix 80 x 1 was given around \n11pm for concern of pulmonary edema and ?frothy pink production. \nICU evaluation was called at 2am. Pt was found to have P 90s SBP \n80s, R 30s (chronic all day), low 90s on NRB. She was \nnon-responsive. Patient family was informed of impending need \nfor intubation. Pt family consented for intubation. Intubation \nwas started and she became hypotensive to 60s\/30s and acute \nbecame asystolic. COde was called. She was started on CPR and 1 \nmg epi was given. Asytole changed to PEA. . 1 mg epi was given. \nSHe was also given 1 amp Ca gluc for low ca from lab before. \nThen, it changed to V Fib, she was shocked once and her pulse \nreturned to 160s BP 90-100. Her BP was drifting down and was \nstarted on levophed. Her EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia. \nHer VS stabilized at P 130s SBP 110-120s and then she was \ntransferred to FICU. SHe received A-line, 1L fluid bolus, \nstarted on propofol for agitation and continued on levophed and \nher antibiotics was changed to \nlinezolid\/zosyn\/foscarnet\/caspofungin to optimize possible VRE \ninfection. Her CXR at FICU s\/p intubation showed nl heart size \nand diffuse, somethwat improved opacitiy but no focal \ninfiltrate. \n..\nShe was diagnosed in [**3456-11-10**] after routine CBC.  A CT scan \nof the abdomen and pelvis showed a large mass in the left upper \nquadrant with numerous enlarged celiac, porta hepatis, splenic \nand hilar lymph[**MD Number 285**]. A fine needle aspirate of the \nretroperitoneal lymph node unfortunately was nondiagnostic and \nshe underwent a bone marrow biopsy and retroperitoneal lymph \nnode biopsy which did prove positive for diffuse large B-cell \nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  She was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP \nresulting in a CR, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and \nautologous stem cell rescue in [**3457-4-11**].  She relapsed with \ndisease in her spleen and underwent a splenectomy in October \n2004.  She received EPOCH with rituximab x 6 cycles, and one \ncycle of Zevalin.   \n\n[**3458-3-12**] PET scan showed an interval increase in the size of \nthe left upper quadrant mass measuring 2.3 x 5 cm when compared \nto 1.1 x 2.8 cm.  There was\nalso an increase in the size of the left diaphragmatic lymph[**MD Number 761**].  She received a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin \nx1 and then underwent radiation therapy, completed on \n[**3458-5-14**].  [**3458-5-17**] underwent a CT scan on a which showed no \nevidence for adenopathy, particularly in the retroperitoneum at \nsites of her prior disease.  A new right upper lobe opacity was \nnoted.

This \nwas followed by an autologous bone marrow transplant as \nconsolidation treatment in [**3457-4-11**]. She relapsed in the spleen \nin [**3457-9-11**] and underwent plenectomy. Patien then had three \ncycles of EPOCH-R, one cycle of ESHAP-R, and Zevalin. She was \nplanned to undergo a non- ablative matched unrelated donor stem \ncell transplant.  \n\nThe PET CT that she had [**4-5**] showed an interval increase in the \nsize of the left upper quadrant mass which now measures 2.3 x 5 \ncm compared to 1.1 x 2.8 cm.  There was also an increase in the \nsize of the left diaphragmatic lymph node which now measures \nnine millimeters. Therefore it was decided that the patient \nwould undergo more chemo with combination of gemcitabine at 1.5 \ngrams per meters squared on day one and eight every three weeks \nwith cisplatin at 50 mg per meters squared on day one and eight. \nHas now finished cycle 1 of  Gemzar\/Cisplatin (last chemo was \n[**4-14**])\n.\n-interstitial pneumonitis\n-hypothyroidism\n-migraine headaches\n-h\/o hyperglycemia on steroid tx.\n-hyperlipidemia\n-s\/p CCY\n-s\/p splenectomy\n-s\/p portacath placement in R subclavian vein\n-TTE on [**3458-1-4**] with preserved LVEF (>70%)\n-h\/o WPW pattern on ECG\n \nSocial History:\nShe lives with her husband.

MUD NONMYELOABLATIVE ALLOGENIC SCT:  Pt was not given Bactrim \nPPX secondary to sulfa allergy.  She was given Campath seven \ndays before transplant.  After the first administration of \nCampath she experienced fever, tachycardia, rigors, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhea.  She was given demerol x2, tylenol, and \nativan.  In addition she was given lopressor for rate control.  \nShe tolerated the subsequent doses of Campath well.  Fludarabine \nwas started five days and Cytoxan\/Mesna four days \npre-transplant.  Cyclosporine was started day -1.  MUD \nnonmyeloblative allogeneic stem cell transplantation was \nperformed on [**3458-5-27**].  GM-CSF was started day three.  She had no \nsignificant signs of hematuria or tamponade\/pericarditis.  \nTolerated therapy well.  Patient engrafted well, with her counts \nimproving appropriately 9 days post-transplant.  Her counts rose \nto a level of 22,000 due to ?GVHD vs. infection, but trended \ndown to normal range.  Two weeks into her post-tx course, \nCyclosporine was held due to possible toxicity and altered MS.  \nIt was evenutally restarted 3 weeks in due to resolution of MS \nchanges, although when MS worsened once again, it was held and \nnot restarted.  During the entire course, her CSA was at times \nsupratherapeutic and thus it was believed may have been causing \nher symptoms.  However symptoms of altered MS persisted once CSA \nwas stopped. \nPatient was placed on SoluMedrol 20mg IV bid for \nimmunosuppression to prevent graft rejection. \n\n2. FEVER\/NEUTROPENIA:  Pt had no further fever until day +1, at \nwhich time she was started on Cefepime in addition to the \nacyclovir and fluconazole PPX that had been started on day -1. \nVancomycin was started day +2. Caspofungin was started day +5.  \nShe spike a fever and flagyl was added for possible C.Dif, \ncultures were negative x2 for C.Dif.  As patient continued into \nher second week, her counts improved, fevers remitted, and \npatient was d\/ced from Flagyl and vancomycin.  As her LFTs began \nrising on [**6-18**], patient was d\/ced from Caspofungin due to \nincreased LFTs.    \n\n3. DIARRHEA:  Pt had continual diarrhea from days -2 to +3.  C. \nDiff cultures x5 were negative.  Pt was given metronidazole \nempirically with resolution of the diarrhea.\n\n4. ALTERED MS: Approximately 2 weeks post-tx, patient began to \nhave altered MS, difficulty with attention\/communicating.  \nNeurology was consulted, patient had a noncontrast head CT that \nwas normal, MRI negative except for chronic microvascular \nischemia, and an LP that was cx negative, and was cytology \nnegative.  HSV, CMV, EBV, Toxo negative.  At the time, patient \nhad an elevated white count, was in acute renal failure with \nelevated BUN, and with fevers, who was thought to be \nencephalopathic.  Pt had an acute change in MS on [**6-28**], with \nnonresponsiveness to sternal rub, touch or command, but had \nspontaneous eye opening and arm movements.  Neuro ordered an EEG \nwhich showed 3 Hz electrical spikes consistant with ?seizures.  \nPt was loaded with Dilantin and followed clinically over the \nlast 5 days.  Pt has continued to be unresponsive. Repeat EEG \n[**7-1**] EEG concerning for post-ictal seizure activity, and a \nrepeat EEG on [**7-6**] continued to show spikes possibly c\/w \nseizures.  We have continued to titrate up her Dilantin per \nNeuro recs until spikes disappear on routine EEG.  On [**7-5**], pt \nwas found to have (+) HHV-6 from her CSF from LP on [**6-28**].  She \nwas started on Foscarnet per ID recs for treatment of HHV-6, \nalthough it is unclear whether all of MS changes are due to \nHHV-6, or ?seizures d\/t HHV-6 infection. \n\n5. WPW PATTERN:  Pt's admission ECG was significant for WPW \npattern and LBB pattern.  She had exhibited this pattern in the \npast and was asymptomatic.  Her tachycardia (both regular WPW \npattern and sinus tachycardia) was managed with metoprolol.  Per \ncardiology recommendations, she was monitored on tele for wide \nqrs patterns, but was recommended to load 100mg procainamide if \nshe became tachycardic with afib, and a wide qrs pattern.  PT \ncontinued to have sinus tachycardia while occasionally switching \ninto a ventricular pre-excitation rhythmn, but never developed \na-fib.  \n\n6. +VRE BACTIURIA\n-Pt was found to have +VRE bactiuria on [**6-25**], her catheter was \nreplaced, and pt was placed on Linezolid 600mg qD.  Pt never had \npositive blood cultures, and her vitals remained stable.  \nBecause pt began to have altered MS, and increase in her LFTs, \npatient's Linezolid was d\/ced after 5 days of therapy due to \n?interactions with MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3172**].   \n\n7. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE\n-Pt was placed on CSA post-tx and developed increasing \nCreatinine levels, decreased UOP, and worsening pleural \neffusions.  Pt was placed on a Lasix drip and the CSA was held.  \nPt's Cr peaked at 1.8, and gradually returned to baseline with \ngood UOP.  Pt diuresed effectively and was taken off of the \nLasix drip.  \n\n8. Hypoxia:  The patient developed new onset shortness of \nbreath.  A CxR found large effusions, L>R on Chest CxR ([**6-12**]).  A \nLasix Drip for diuresis was started with good urine output.  She \nthen had a thoracentesis x2 which removed the left sided \neffusion.  She remained stable on RA - 2L O2 with an oxygen \nsaturation at 95%.\n8. FEN:  Patient was started on TPN [**5-27**]. It was continued to \nreplete her albumin level, which may have contributed to her \nfluid overload.  D\/ced when tolerating PO, and restarted \nrecently when pt's MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 745**] and pt was not tolerating PO \ndiet. \nMore recently on [**7-5**], pt began to have worsening tachypnia, \nalthough was still satting 94-95% on 2L.  \n\n9. HYPOTHYROID: continued synthroid 100 mcg QD, and switched to \nSynthroid 50mg IV qD when not tolerating PO meds. \n\n10. MIGRAINE:  discontinued verapamil 120 mg QD, no symptoms \nthroughout hospitalization.\n\nContinued Hospital Course:\n\nO\/N on [**7-7**], pt was noted to have increased work of breathing \nwith hypoxia up on bone marrow transplant floor.  At this time \nit was decided that she would be intubated on the floor and then \nbe transported to the ICU for further care, as she was too \nunstable to  be transported prior to intubation.  During \nintubation, pt became asystolic and ACLS protocol was followed.  \nShe then transferred to PEA and ACLS protocol was changed \naccordingly.  She then transferred to V-fib and ACLS protocol \nwas again changed accordingly and she regained sinus rhythm with \npulse after initial defibrillation.  Pt was transported to ICU \nand her care continued there.  \n  Initially pt was kept on caspofungin and foscarnet and other \nabx were changed to zosyn and linezolid to ensure broad coverage \nas etiology of her worsening medical condition was not known.  \nShe also required transient pressure support with neosynephrine \nwhen initially transferred but was subsequently weaned off.\n  During ICU stay, pt was evaluated and consulted by ID, who \nrecommended changing Imipenem to daptomycin for less Bone marrow \nsuppression, so that was performed.  Neurology was also seeing \npt as she had been in ?status during stay on bone marrow \ntransplant wards.  During this time, dilantin dose was adjusted \nand bedside EEG monitoring was performed which demonstrated \ndecreased amplitude, decreased spike activity.\n  Approximately 48 hours after presentation to ICU, pt became \nincreasingly difficult to ventilate, with PaO2 dropping to below \n60 on ABG, requiring increasingly elevated FiO2 and PEEP.  On \nher 3rd day in the ICU, pt became increasingly acidemic and \nhypotensive, requiring pt to be placed back on neosynephrine \npressure support.  When pt's pH dropped < 2, pt was placed on \nTham x 500mL for non-HCO3 buffer, which transiently raised her \npH to 7.2, but it subsequently dropped again below 7.2.  During \nthis time, family was informed of the critical nature of the \n[**Hospital 101**] medical problems and they decided to make the patient \nDNR and also to not escalate the current amount of intervention, \nspecifically they did not want to dialize the patient and they \ndid not want to add another pressor if her blood pressure \nrequired.\n  Throughout the day on pt's 3rd day in ICU, she became \nincreasingly acidemic, with increasing Neosynephrine requirement \nuntil the maximum dose of the pressor was reached.  At \napproximately 8:40pm on [**7-9**] pt's heart stopped after BP \ndropping and HR dropping over previous hours.  Pt's family was \nat bedside.  They agreed to full autopsy of pt, as they believed \nshe would want people to learn from her case.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nVanco\/cefipime 2 q 8\/caspofungin\/foscarnet\nursodial bid\nmethylprednisone 20 q 12\nlevothyroxine\nISS \nmiconazole powder\ndilantin 200 q 12\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nCardiac Failure\nRespiratory Failure\n \nDischarge Condition:\nDeath\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nNone\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nNone\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1090**] MD [**MD Number 1091**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1925**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3173**] MD [**MD Number 3174**] [**3458-7-16**] @ 1517\nSigned electronically by: DR.

Severe tricompartmental degenerative change, worse within the \nmedial and lateral compartments.\n2. Large knee joint effusion. Hemarthrosis cannot be excluded on \nthe basis of this radiograph.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n80 year old female who presented with chest pain and SOB and \nfound to have multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli\n.\n1) Pulmonary Emboli - Patient had evidence of DVT of right leg \non exam, and this was the likely source of the pulmonary emboli. \n DVT occured in setting of decreased ambulation at \nrehabilitation facility and inadequate anticoagulation with \naggrenox (used to prevent recurrence of CVA).  The patient was \nstarted on heparin and coumadin in the ICU to prevent further \nthrombosis.  Lysis, filter, or thrombectomy was not indicated as \nthe patient was hemodynamically stable except for a low BP \nintially that responded to IVF's.  The patient was ruled out for \nMI with CK and trop x 3 negative.  She was transferred to the \nfloor on the morning after admission and heparin and coumadin \nwere continued.  Her chest pain and SOB improved daily and the \npatient was without chest pain or difficutly breathing on the \nday of discharge.  INR on discharge was 1.9 with the goal of >2 \nfor 48hrs.  Therefore heparin is to be continued at \nrehabilitation facility until this occurs.  Will need to \nanticoagulate with coumadin for 6 months, maintain O2 sats > \n92%.  \n.\n2) Osteoarthritis\/Hemarthrosis - Once transferred from the ICU \nthe patient had increasing pain in both knees, but the right \nknee was significantly worse to the point of being unable to \nmove d\/t severe pain and inflammation.  R knee film showed \nsevere degenerative joint disease with large effusion.  Ortho \nconsulted and they tapped the knee, which was grossly bloody.  \nWBC count 1500 with negative gram stain and diagnosis was \nhemarthrosis in setting of anticoagulationn.  Unable to do a \ntherapeutic tap likely because blood had clotted.  Treatement \nconsisted of knee immobilizer ordered, ice  Q2hrs, elevation of \nknee, and adequate pain control.  PT\/OT was unable to work with \npatient for most of her hospital stay d\/t presence of femoral \nline (needed for hep gtt\/meds as only one periphal).  \nOthropedics suggest that patient move RLE as soon as possible to \nprevent lock knee, and progress activity as tolerated by \npatient.  Ortho (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2467**]) happy to follow-up with patient if \nclinically indicated in the future.\n.\n3) Pain - Initially was due chest pain from PE, but this \nresolved with vicodin.  Also has severe knee\/leg pain that \nmarkedly improved on SR oxycontin 10 mg PO BID, breakthrough \noxycodone 10 mg PO Q4, and RTC tylenol.  Patient was pain free \non the day of discharge, maintained on bowel regimen of colace, \nsenna, and dulcolax.\n.\n4) Fever - Patient spiked to 101 on [**8-11**] and did not spike \nthereafter. UA sent which was negative.  Urine culture, blood \ncultures from [**8-12**] have shown NGTD.  Lung exam clear with no \nsymptoms of cough or SOB.  Femoral line pulled on [**8-12**].  \nCatheter tip cultured and NGTD.  Deferred placement of PICC line \nin setting of previous fevers and thought that heparin could be \nadministered through IV and all other meds PO.\n.\n5) H\/O CVA - During previous hospitalization, it was thought \nthat CVA was due to embolic vs. ischemic.  Patient was put on \naggrenox for prevention of further episode. During that \nadmission and irregular rhythm was documented on exam, but no \nEKG or telemetry findings confirming this.  On this admission \npatient was found to be in Afib on EKG and tele from admission.  \nNow that patient has documented Afib and AFib was found on \nphysical exam d[**MD Number 278**] last admission for CVA, likely cause of CVA \nwas embolic from atrium rather than ischemic.  Therefore it was \ndecided to d\/c aggrenox and treat with coumadin for PE\/afib\/CVA \nprophylaxis.  Continues to have right sided weakness, unchanged \nfrom baseline (except inability to move\/bend right lower \nextremity d\/t hemarthrosis.\n- D\/C'd aggrenox as coumadin treatment for CVA d\/t embolic \nsource in setting of Afib\n.\n6) Access - Femoral line out, 1 peripheral\n.\n7) Anemia - Patient with HCT generally in high 20's.  Baseline \nmid 30's, fell to high 20's during last hospital admission for \nCVA.  Iron studies show anemia of inflammation, but may also \nhave an element of iron deficiency.  Retic count normal last \nadmission when it should have been elevated, so may have a \ndegree of marrow underproduction.  Had a three point drop in HCT \nin one day, likely source blood loss into right knee.  No \nevidence for GI loss as guaic negative.  Would recommend iron to \ntreat any element of iron deficiency.  Recommend following daily \nHCT's.\n.\n8) Afib - This was found on physical exam d[**MD Number 278**] last admission \nfor stroke, but no episodles identified on telemetry and not \ndocumented on EKG.  TTE in 7\/05 with no evidence of thrombus, \nASD, PFO.  Now that Afib documented during this admission , she \nwill need chronic anticoagulation with coumadin, especially in \nthe setting of previous CVA.  Will continue heparin gtt and \ncoumadin and stop heparin once INR > 2 (in conjunction with plan \nfor PE).\n.\n9) FEN - Ate well on cardiac\/heart healthy diet.  Lytes were \nfollowed and and repleted for K>4, Mg>2\n.\n10) PPX - On PPI, anticoagulated, bowel regimen with colace, \nsenna, dulcolax\n.\n11) Code - Full, discussed with nephew who is health care proxy \n(confirmed - nephew was not available at time of admission but \nboth nephew and patient have confirmed that nephew is health \ncare proxy).\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

History is taken from his\nwife who is the translator and the Emergency Department\ncharts.\n\nOne day prior to admission the patient had nausea, vomiting,\nand bloody diarrhea with bright red blood per rectum and a\nlarge volume of hematemesis times two.  He felt lightheaded\nand short of breath when going to the bathroom.  He never had\ngastrointestinal bleeding in the past.  The patient denies\nchest pain, lower extremity edema, cough, fever, or chills.\nHe called his primary care physician who advised him to go to\nthe Emergency Department.\n\nIn the Emergency Department he had continued epigastric pain\nand received nasogastric lavage with 1 liter without\nclearing.  He was seen by Gastrointestinal who deferred\nendoscopy for an INR of 4.  The patient was given blood\ntransfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K in the\nEmergency Department.

In general, an elderly\ngentleman, alert in bed, in minimal distress.  Head, ears,\nnose, eyes and throat was normocephalic and atraumatic.\nRight sclerae with erythema.  Mucous membranes were moist.\nOropharynx without lesions.  Neck was supple, neck veins\nflat.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest was clear to auscultation\nbilaterally.  Cardiovascular was regular.  No murmurs, rubs\nor gallops appreciated.  Abdomen had normal active bowel\nsounds, obese, soft nontender, nondistended, guaiac-positive.\nExtremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White count 12.9,\nhematocrit 34.6, platelets 350.  PT 24.1, INR 4, PTT 37.5.\nSodium 139, potassium 5.6, chloride 105, bicarbonate 19,\nblood urea nitrogen 45, creatinine 1.7, glucose 352.\nCreatine kinase 100, MB 4, troponin of less than 0.3.\n\nRADIOLOGY\/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram with sinus rhythm\nat 88 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, Q wave in\nII, III, and aVF, ST segment depressions in V2 through V5.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 3491**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 392**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for\nfurther treatment of his acute bleeding.  He was intubated\nfor impending esophagogastroduodenoscopy and hemodynamic\ninstability which included tachycardia and increased blood\npressure.  The patient received 5 units of packed red blood\ncells, 5 units of fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K, along\nwith intravenous fluids.  The patient's INR went from 4\nto 1.3.\n\nSubsequently esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which\nrevealed diffuse nodularity, a clot in the fundus, and some\nsmall polys, and erosions, but there was no active source of\nbleeding.  No biopsies were done at that time.\n\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Cardiology was asked to evaluate the\npatient, and they recommended short-acting beta blocker to\nmaintain systolic blood pressure below 200 and heart rate\nbelow the 150s.  The patient was started on an esmolol drip\nwithe good affect.  However, during the hospitalization, the\npatient's cardiac enzymes revealed an elevated troponin which\ninitially was less than 0.3 and rising to 2.8 on [**2818-12-6**] and decreasing to 0.5 by [**2818-12-13**].  This was\nthought to be demand ischemia.  Given the patient's acute\nproblems, his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1561**] recommended a stress\ntest as an outpatient at a later date when other issues have\nstabilized.\n\nThe patient has a history of atrial fibrillation well\ncontrolled on procainamide and anticoagulation with Coumadin.\nGiven his acute gastrointestinal bleed Cardiology recommended\ndiscontinuation of Coumadin, and because the patient has been\nin sinus rhythm for over seven years it was thought that the\npatient can also stop procainamide.  However, the patient\nwent into atrial fibrillation on [**12-10**] and was quickly\ncardioverted chemically with intravenous procainamide.\n\nBecause of the patient's chronic renal insufficiency he was\nstarted on maintenance amiodarone.  Initially, the patient\nreceived 400 mg of amiodarone t.i.d. for one week, and\ncurrently is taking 400 mg of amiodarone q.d. for three\nmonths, and thereafter he will take 200 mg p.o. q.d.  The\npatient has been in stable normal sinus rhythm since\ncardioversion on [**12-11**].\n\n2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted to the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit with a brisk upper\ngastrointestinal bleed and was transfusion, in total, 9 units\nof blood and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma.  The patient's\nINR was rapidly corrected and endoscopy was emergently done.\nIt showed no evidence of active bleeding but there was\ndiffuse and continuous erythema, congestion, nodularity, and\nmosaic of the mucosa of the stomach without bleeding\nespecially at the antrum, stomach body, and pylorus.  There\nwas blood in the whole stomach and erosions at the antrum.\nHowever, there was no active bleeding noted.  The patient was\nstarted on Protonix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.\n\nOver the course of the hospitalization the patient's\nhematocrit remained stable above 30, and his stools became\nguaiac-negative toward the end of the hospitalization.\nFurthermore, the patient was found to be Helicobacter pylori\npositive during this admission, and he was begun on triple\ntherapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori which\nincluded clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and Prevacid.\n\n3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was aggressively transfused to\nmaintain a hematocrit of 30, and over the course of the\nhospital developed worsening congestive heart failure which\nwas treated with Lasix successfully.  He was extubated on\n[**12-10**] without problems.\n\n4.  RENAL:  The patient has a history of chronic renal\ninsufficiency with a creatinine between 1.6 and 2.1.  Because\nof the patient's congestive heart failure he was treated with\nLasix aggressively and found to have an increasing creatinine\nwith a maximum of 2.9.  At the time his urine was spun and\nfound to have muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular\nnecrosis.  At that time, the patient's lung examination was\nclear and his ACE inhibitor and Lasix were held for the\nremainder of the hospitalization.  This resulted in\nimprovement in the patient's creatinine.  At the time of this\ndictation the creatinine was at 2.1 and trending downward.\nWe will restart the patient's ACE inhibitor and Lasix after\nhis renal function level is down to baseline.\n\n5.  NUTRITION:  After extubation bedside examination revealed\nthat the patient was at risk for aspiration as he would cough\nwith thin liquids.  More formal testing with video swallow\nrevealed that the patient indeed frankly aspirated thin\nliquids and also thick liquids, and with regard to intake of\nsoft solids the patient had residual in the vallecula which\nwas concerning for aspiration.  Based on this it was\nrecommended for the patient to be kept strictly n.p.o. and\nhis swallowing reassessed at a later date.\n\nThe etiology of the patient's inability to swallow remains\nunclear.  It is possible this may be neurologic; however,\nthere are no other neurologic findings suggestive of a\nhypoxic hit to the brain.  At this time we feel that it is\nmost likely trauma during the intubation process or\nextubation process coupled with deconditioning resulting in a\nweak swallowing musculature.  It will likely take some time\nfor this to recover, and out best sense is that it may take\nweeks to months.  Given this assessment it was recommended\nthat the patient undergo a percutaneous gastrotomy tube for\nnutrition and medications.  This was placed without issue one\nday prior to discharge and the patient was started on\nUltra-Cal tube feeding with a goal of 80 cc an hour, giving\n2035 kilocalories and 85 g of protein.  This assessment was\nmade based upon this patient's basal metabolic needs as\ncalculated by the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3492**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3493**] equation.  Furthermore, the\npatient will need free-water boluses q.i.d. at 300 cc to\n400 cc each.\n\n6.  ENDOCRINOLOGY:  The patient has a history of type 2\ndiabetes now requiring insulin.  He reports the use of NPH at\nhome, although the doses are unclear.  We would therefore\nrecommend that fingersticks blood glucoses be checked q.i.d.\nand the patient's insulin regimen adjusted accordingly.\n\nAt the time of discharge the patient's NPH insulin was at\n20 q.a.m. and 20 q.p.m. with a regular insulin sliding-scale\nto maintain a blood glucose between 150 and 200.  In order to\ndo this close monitoring of blood glucose and adjustments to\nthe patient's NPH insulin will be necessary.\n\n7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  As mentioned above the patient was\nHelicobacter pylori positive and a course of treatment was\ninitiated.  In addition, the patient was also found to have\nMoraxella pneumonia which was treated with a course of\nlevofloxacin.  Several days prior to discharge the patient\nwas noted to have a right upper lobe infiltrate which, given\nthe patient's aspiration risks, we felt that it was\nreasonable to extend his levofloxacin coverage for an\nadditional five days.  The patient remained afebrile\nthroughout the hospitalization with a normal white count.\n\n8.  REHABILITATION:  Having been in the hospital for a\nrelatively extended period the patient's strength and ability\nto ambulate progressively worsened during this\nhospitalization.  Therefore, we feel that the patient would\nbenefit from a course of physical rehabilitation to increase\nhis strength, and as his nutrition increases his swallowing\nmay also improve with increased physical mobility and\nreconditioning.\n\nAt the time of this dictation the patient was stable from a\nmedical perspective for transfer to a rehabilitation facility\nwith the goal of sending the patient home in the near future.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Markedly improved.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital3 511**] in\n[**Location (un) 3494**], [**State 277**] (telephone number [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 3495**]).\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (As in Past Medical History and\ninclude)\n1.

The patient awoke on the\nmorning of admission with severe substernal chest pain,\nshortness of breath, and diaphoresis.  The patient stated\nthat she had never experienced these symptoms before.\n\nShe went to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital 450**] Hospital\nwhere she was found to have electrocardiogram abnormalities\nwith ST segment elevation in V1-V5 and Q-wave in V1 and V2.\nCompared to her prior electrocardiogram, these changes were\nnew.\n\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was given Aspirin,\nstarted on a Nitroglycerin drip, and was administered\nLovenox.  TB3A inhibitor and thrombolytics were held due to\nconcern for possible left-sided facial droop.  The patient\ndid have a head CT which was negative for bleed at the\noutside hospital.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 283**] for further management.\n\nThe patient was taken directly for cardiac catheterization.\nCoronary angiography of her right dominant system revealed\nthree-vessel disease.  The LMCA was free of flow-limiting\nlesions.  The left anterior descending was totally occluded\nproximally.  The left circumflex had a proximal 70% stenosis\nand mild luminal irregularities throughout.  The dominant\nright coronary artery had mild luminal irregularities\nthroughout with a 50-60% stenosis in its mid segment.  The\noccluded proximal left anterior descending was successfully\ntreated by AngioJet and stenting using two overlapping stents\nextending from the proximal to mid left anterior descending.\nFinal angiography revealed no residual stenosis within the\nstents.  There was no angiographic evidence of dissection in\nFAST TIMI-2 flow.  There was a severe, diffuse disease in the\ndistal left anterior descending which was left untreated.\n\nDuring the procedure, the patient was given Dopamine and\nNeo-Synephrine, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism.  Left hip fracture.\nRight humerus fracture sustained approximately two weeks ago.\n\nALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone p.r.n., Levothyroxine, Aspirin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day times 60\nyears.  She denied use of alcohol and drugs.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was an elderly\nfemale lying in bed in no apparent distress.  Vital signs:\nTemperature 96.4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, pulse 118, blood pressure 133\/81,\nrespirations 16, oxygen saturation 95% on nonrebreather.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and\nreactive to light.  Slight left eye droop.  Moist mucous\nmembranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple.  Difficult to\nassess jugular venous distention.  Heart:  Regular, rate and\nrhythm.  Heart sounds muffled by intra-aortic balloon pump.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft,\nnontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Left femoral\ngroin line present.  Right arm immobilized in sling.\nNeurological:  The patient was alert and oriented times\nthree.  There was a left eye droop.  Exam otherwise nonfocal.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.1, hematocrit 31.8, platelet\ncount 320; initial CK 66, MB 3; chemistry showed a BUN and\ncreatinine of 11 and 1.\n\nElectrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm, 80 beats per minute,\nnormal intervals, slight left axis deviation, ST segment\nelevation in V2-V5, ST segment depression in II, III and AVF.\n\nHead CT at the outside hospital was negative for bleed.\n\nIMPRESSION:  This was a 78-year-old female with history of\ntobacco use and hypothyroidism who was found to have acute\nanterior wall myocardial infarction status post\ncatheterization with stents to left anterior descending.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for\nfurther management.\n\n1.  Cardiology\/ischemia:  The patient was administered\nPlavix, beta-blocker, Aspirin, statin, and an ACE inhibitor\nwas introduced as her blood pressure tolerated.  As noted\nabove, cardiac catheterization disclosed three-vessel\ncoronary artery disease.  There was also severe systolic and\ndiastolic ventricular dysfunction.\n\nHer acute anterior myocardial infarction was managed by acute\nPTCA.  She underwent successful AngioJet and stenting of the\noccluded proximal left anterior descending, as well as\nsuccessful placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.\n\nDue to the finding of three-vessel disease, CT Surgery was\nconsulted.  The patient will be seen by CT Surgery on [**3-10**], 2:30, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 827**].  At that point, Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 14**] will determine when the patient should go to OR.\nCoumadin and Plavix should be discontinued one week prior to\nsurgery.\n\nLipid panel:  Was obtained during the hospitalization.  The\npatient's LDL was mildly elevated at 107.  She will continue\non Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n\nPump:  As noted above, the patient was initially on\nNeo-Synephrine and Dopamine, as well as intra-aortic balloon\npump when she came out of the catheterization lab.  These\npressors were eventually weaned off, and the intra-aortic\nballoon pump was also discontinued.\n\nThe patient underwent echocardiogram on [**3447-2-12**].  The\nresults of the echocardiogram disclosed a left atrium normal\nin size.  There was moderate regional left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal\nhalf of the anterior septum, apex and distal anterior wall,\nright ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\nnormal, no aortic regurgitation seen.  The mitral valve\nleaflets were mildly thickened.  There was mild 1+ mitral\nregurgitation.  There was mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension.  There was trivial physiologic pericardial\neffusion.\n\nAnticoagulation:  The patient was started on Coumadin.  The\npatient was maintained on Heparin during her hospital stay.\nShe was started on Coumadin on [**3447-2-15**], due to\nechocardiogram findings of severe hypokinesis of the anterior\nwall.  The patient's goal INR is 1.8-2.5.\n\nRhythm:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm d[**MD Number 850**]\nher hospital stay.  She was monitored closely on telemetry.\n\n2.  Hematologic:  The patient was noted to be anemic on\nadmission with a hematocrit of 31.8.  She was given 2 U\npacked red blood cells on [**2-11**].  Iron studies, B12 and\nfolate were within normal limits; however ferratin was on the\nlow end of normal at 26.  Due to concern for iron deficiency,\nthe patient should undergo colonoscopy as an outpatient.\n\n3.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient noted that she had a\nhumerus fracture two weeks prior to her presentation.\nShoulder film at [**Hospital6 84**]\ndisclosed a fracture involving the surgical neck and greater\ntubercle of the humerus.  There was mild impaction and\nanterior displacement of the distal fragment.\n\nThe patient was seen by the Orthopedic Service who\nrecommended that the patient be maintained in a sling.  She\nmay do passive range of motion and assisted active range of\nmotion exercises.  They recommended pain control as needed\nand that she should follow-up with Orthopedics in 1-2 weeks.\n\n4.  Psychiatry:  The patient has a significant smoking\nhistory.  The patient underwent counseling for smoking\ncessation and was maintained on a Nicotine patch during her\nhospital stay.\n\n5.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism.\nThe patient was maintained on Levothyroxine during her\nhospital stay.\n\n6.  Infectious disease:  On [**2-13**], the patient spiked a\ntemperature and was noted to have an area of\ncellulitis\/phlebitis on her left upper extremity.  Blood\ncultures were drawn, and 1 out of 2 bottles initially grew\nMRSA.  The patient is to be treated with Vancomycin for a\n14-day course via PICC line.  The patient did have additional\nsets of blood cultures drawn.  These should be followed for\norganisms.  Echocardiogram should be considered.  Since the\npatient looks clinically well, it is likely that this initial\norganism was a contaminant.  The patient has remained\nafebrile since [**2-13**].\n\n7.  FEN:  The patient was maintained on a cardiac\nheart-healthy diet during her hospital stay.  She was noted\nto have hyponatremia with a sodium of 128 on [**2-16**].  Urine\nelectrolytes were sent off, and sodium was noted to be less\nthan 10.  Hyponatremia was likely due to the patient's heart\nfailure.  Her sodium should be monitored while she is at\nrehabilitation.  The patient's fluid intake should be\nrestricted to 1.5 L a day.\n\n8.  Renal:  The patient's renal function has remained stable\nduring her hospital stay.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a\nrehabilitation facility.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1.  The patient will follow-up with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14**] from CT Surgery on [**3-10**], 2:30 p.m.  Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 5440**] office is located at [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5441**].  2.

Due to the patient's anemia, she should undergo\ncolonoscopy as an outpatient.  5.  The patient's blood\ncultures drawn at [**Hospital6 84**] should\nbe followed; the set from [**2-15**] has been negative for 48\nhours.  6.  The patient's sodium should be followed closely\nwhile she is at rehabilitation.  Her fluids should be\nrestricted to 1.5 L\/day.  7.  The patient's INR should be\nfollowed closely with goal INR of 1.8-2.5.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease.\n2.

He underwent a debulking left nephrectomy with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 899**] on [**3173-6-11**], and was diagnosed with metastatic\nkidney cancer by thyroidectomy in [**3173-4-21**].  This\nrevealed high grade renal cell carcinoma that was metastatic\nto the adrenal gland.  Following debulking nephrectomy, he\nwas found to be presented with severe bone pain.  Location of\nhis pain was in the right shoulder.  Given that the pain did\nnot resolve, he underwent a MRI which showed ultimately a\nlytic lesion in the right shoulder and was treated with\nradiation therapy to the shoulder as well as ultimately\nundergoing treatment with chemotherapy.  He did not respond\nto chemotherapy and developed a large lytic lesion in the\nleft femur requiring an operative embolization and rod\nplacement in 02\/2003.  Following that, he had multiple\nradiation therapies to the spine as well as right scapula as\nwell as left femur.\n\nHe was seen on multiple occasions over the last several weeks\ncomplaining of increasing pain in the right shoulder.  CT\nscan revealed a large lytic lesion.  Given that this area had\nbeen radiated twice, tentatively booked to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\nin Radiology for radiofrequency ablation for pain relief.  He\nhas been on OxyContin 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Morphine elixir\nfor breakthrough pain, and he has been a little better over\nthe last few days.  He has not moved his bowels in three\ndays, and also had difficulty urinating.  This initially felt\nto be related to the increase in narcotic, but now he\ndescribes difficulty feeling a full bladder, and had been\nvoiding very little over the last day.  He was admitted to\nthe Oncology service for workup of this urinary retention.\nHe is also complaining of leg weakness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was a gentleman in no acute\ndistress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to\nlight.  EOMs full.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and\nrhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft,\nnondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Neurologically, cranial\nnerves II through XII intact.  His motor strength is [**2-23**] in\nthe right upper extremity, [**3-25**] in the left upper extremity,\nand [**3-25**] on bilateral lower extremities.  His reflexes in the\nupper extremities and lower extremities is symmetric, and\nsensation to cold and pin prick and light touch bilaterally,\ngait are normal.  There is no saddle anesthesia.\n\nHe was admitted now with urinary retention and bowel\nretention likely due to increased pain medication, but will\nrule out cord compression.  He had a MRI of his cervical\nspine, which showed evidence of tumor at the T1-T3 level with\nmoderate-to-severe cord compression.  Also disease at the T1\nlevel causing some deformity of the spinal cord.  Therefore\nNeurosurgery was consulted.\n\nThe patient was taken to the Neurosurgery service and brought\nto the operating room for decompression laminectomy of the\nthoracic and cervical spine.  First on [**3174-7-21**], underwent\na thoracic embolization of the tumor, and then was taken to\nthe operating room on [**3174-7-22**], and underwent T2-T3\nresection of metastatic lesions, spinal cord decompression\nwith segmental C7-T4 stabilization.\n\nPostoperative, his vital signs were stable.  He was afebrile.\nHis motor strength was [**3-25**] in all muscle groups.  He had no\npronator drift.  His laboratories were within normal limits.\nHe was neurologically stable and transferred to the regular\nfloor.  He has had two drains in place, which stayed in until\npostoperative day #5.  He had minimal output of both drains\non day five, and they were pulled.  Continued on IV\nantibiotic treatment while drains were in place.  His\nincisions were clean, dry, and intact.  He was seen by\nPhysical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, and was thought to\npossibly acquire rehab, although made significant improvement\nover his hospital stay, and opted for discharge to home with\nfollowup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 281**] in two weeks for staple removal.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

She was initially transferred to the FICU in August \nafter developing altered mental status and hypoxia on the floor. \n While in the ICU, she was intubated and extubated 4 different \ntimes.  An etiology of her respiratory failure was never \nestablished, although she was treated for diffuse alveolar \nhemorrhage, pneumonia, and CHF.  She would initially recover \nwith mechanical ventilatory support and then worsen 2-7 days \npost-extubation, requiring reintubation.  Her course was \ncomplicated by what was felt to be chemo-related CHF with an EF \nof 20%, which improved on a subsequent echo.  From an ID \nstandpoint, she never grew anything from any of her studies \nexcept for a mold from one of her bronchs (species Curvularia) \nwhich was felt to be a contaminant.  She also developed renal \nfailure [**1-4**] cyclosporine which resolved.  She was felt to have \nTTP as well.  Approximately 1.5 weeks prior to her death, she \nwas extubated and did well initially.  Her mental status \nimproved greatly once she was off all sedation, and she was able \nto interact meaningfully with her family.  She was transferred \nupstairs to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name **] and began to do poorly, becoming \nincreasingly hypoxic.  She was transferred back to the ICU and \nwas intubated.  She became hypotensive requiring 3 pressors.  \nShe then developed status epilepticus, unresponsive to ativan, \ndilantin, and phenobarbitol.  She was evaluated by neurology at \nthat time, who felt she had likely suffered an intracranial \nhemorrhage.  The attending oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] spoke with \nthe family, who agreed to extubate her and allow her to die \npeacefully, which she did on [**2872-8-27**] with her family at her \nside.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCefepime 2g iv tid\nCytarabine 100mg\/meter-sq iv over 24 hrs x 7 days\nIdarubicin 12 mg\/[**Last Name (un) **]-sq IV on days 1,2,3\nAnzemet 100mg po qd x 5 days\nAmbien 5mg po qhs prn\nvancomycin 1gm po q 12h\nDiflucan 200 mg qd\n \nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nAML\n \nDischarge Condition:\nnone\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nnone\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nnone\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 961**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2515**] MD [**MD Number 2519**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6952**] MD [**MD Number 6953**] [**2872-9-11**] @ 1825\nSigned electronically by: DR.

Although the patient appeared septic\nupon presentation with an elevated lactate and hypotension,\nthere was no clear evidence of infection.  Blood pressure\nimproved and the patient was weaned off pressors after 1\nnight.  There have been no source or other evidence of\ninfection.  Therefore, antibiotics were discontinued.  The\npatient did have multiple episodes of diarrhea but she was C.\ndifficile negative.\n\nHypoxia.  Again, there was no clear etiology of the patient's\nhypoxia.  She was extubated without difficulty and remained\non room air for the rest of her hospitalization.\n\nSyncope.  The patient was kept on telemetry.  However, there\nwas no evidence of arrhythmia.

ESRD: the pt was admitted for HD cath placement and \ntransition to peritoneal dialysis.  He continues to make urine, \nbut has persistent renal failure requiring dialysis. On \nadmission, his tunneled HD catheter was not functional, \nrequiring placement of R femoral catheter that was later \ncomplicated by femoral bleed as below.  Following bleed, femoral \ncatheter was removed and temporary HD catheter was placed.  The \npt received HD per the Renal service during his admission \nthrough his temp catheters.  Before d\/c, peritoneal catheter was \nplaced by the Transplant Surgery service.  At the time of d\/c, \nthe newly implanted catheter is clean and intact.  The pt will \nf\/u with Renal clinic to arrange transition to PD after d\/c.  \n  \n2. CAD: he is s\/p CABG in 9\/04, w\/ no evidence of active \nischemia during his admission.  He had transient SSCP during \nactive femoral bleeding, but ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes \nand was pain free for the rest of his stay.  Treatment was \ncontinued w\/ his outpt regimen of ASA, carvedilol, and \nlisinopril during his stay.  \n  \n3. Afib: he was rate controlled during his admission on \namiodarone, digoxin, and carvedilol, and was therapeutic on \ncoumadin.  Coumadin was held on admission given need for PD cath \nplacement.  After d\/c, the pt will continue his usual outpt \nregimen and will f\/u with his PCP to determine the need for \nresuming coumadin therapy.\n\n4. Anemia: he was profoundly anemic on admission, most likely \n[**2-23**] underproduction of blood [**2-23**] renal disease. This was \nsupported by low retic count in this setting.  There was no \nevidence of hemolysis given normal haptoglobin and LDH.  Iron \nstudies were normal.  He was guaiac negative.  HCT dropped \ntransiently to nadir of 15 in setting of femoral bleed, \nrequiring PRBC transfusion to HCT of 27.  The pt's HCT then \nstabilized at 27.  Treatment was started w\/ epogen during HD.  \nAt d\/c, there is no evidence of active bleeding.  The pt will \ncontinue epogen therapy after d\/c.\n\n5. Thrombocytopenia: low platelets on admission were of unclear \netiology. No evidence of platelet consumption; no splenomegaly \non exam.  HIT antibody was negative. Platelets were stable \nduring his admission.\n\n6. Right femoral bleed: he had bleeding into his right thigh [**2-23**] \nwalking to the bathroom after placement of temporary dialysis \ncatheter in R femoral vein on [**3233-2-23**]. The pt had grossly \nedematous right leg, and CT scan showed large R thigh hematoma.  \nThe pt was transferred to the MICU for close monitoring, where \nit was clear that the bleeding had stopped and the pt was \nhemodynamically stable.  There were no signs of infxn in the leg \nduring his stay.  He was transferred back to the Medicine \nservice for ongoing care, and again demonstrated no evidence of \nactive bleeding or infxn in the R thigh.  At d\/c, he has \nextensive echymosis of the R thigh, but no edema and good LE \ncirculation B.  \n\n7.

There are multiple \nbilateral regions of subacute infarction with regions of \ncortical restricted diffusion and T2 hyperintensity. The most \nextensive region involves the right insular cortex and the \nparietal cortex, more posteriorly, on the right. There is also a \nsmaller infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory as \nwell. In addition, there are bilateral subacute infarcts in the \nmedial frontal lobes bilaterally, more extensive on the right \nthan the left, involing portions of both anterior cerebral \nartery territories. The posterior cerebral artery territories \nappear spared. All of the infarcted regions show subtle gyriform \nenhancement following gadolinium administration.\n\nBoth cerebral hemispheres also demonstrate scattered foci of T2 \nhyperintensity without associated restricted diffusion or \nenhancement. These are probably more chronic in character. There \nare also multiple tiny bilateral punctate foci of susceptibility \nartifact, which could possibly represent hemorrhagic residua \nfrom prior small-vessel infarctions. The cerebellum and \nbrainstem are spared. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue \nstructures are unremarkable.\n\nMR ANGIOGRAM: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 2046**] \nappear patent. There are no areas of significant stenosis or \naneurysmal dilatation. No sign of arteriovenous malformation is \napparent within the limits of coverage of the study. There is a \nsmall right vertebral artery, which probably ends as a posterior \ninferior cerebellar artery.\n\nMR VENOGRAM: The major intracranial venous sinuses, cerebral \nvein of [**Male First Name (un) 4076**], and internal cerebral vein appear patent.\n----\n[**1-4**]:MRI\/A of head:There is no extra-axial fluid collection. \nThere is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally \nmidline structures. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are \nunremarkable, without effacement.\n\nThe areas of previously noted acute infarction in the bilateral \nmiddle and anterior cerebral artery territories now show T2 \nhyperintensity, consistent with anticipated ongoing evolution of \nthe infarcts.\n\nIn addition, there are new foci of T2 hyperintensity in the \nlentiform nuclei bilaterally and the right thalamus. There is a \ngap in the diffusion- weighted images in this area, so that the \nbasal ganglia regions are not fully assessed with respect to \ndiffusion. However, the new FLAIR abnormality in the right \nthalamus is shown to correspond to a region of new restricted \ndiffusion. These areas correspond to new infarcts since the \nprior study.\n\nThere are new air fluid levels in the sphenoid and maxillary \nsinuses, which could be related to intubation. The surrounding \nosseous and soft tissue structures are within normal limits.\n\nMR ANGIOGRAM: The quality of MR angiogram of the circle of \n[**Location (un) 2046**] is improved since the prior study. Again, it demonstrates \nno significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation. A small right \nvertebral artery, ending as a posterior inferior cerebellar \nartery, is again noted.\n----\nCT abd-pelv to r\/o retroperitoneal hematoma [**1-12**]:\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Consolidation is again \nnoted at both lung bases, unchanged from the prior study. An NG \ntube is present within the stomach. The spleen, liver, \ngallbladder, pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, and intraabdominal \nsmall bowel are unremarkable in appearance. The colon is again \nnoted to be distended and full of stool. No bowel wall \nthickening is seen. There is no free air, free fluid, or \npathologic lymphadenopathy in the abdomen.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, and \nbladder are unremarkable. A Foley catheter is present, and some \nair is again noted within the bladder. There is no free fluid or \nlymphadenopathy.\n\nOsseous structures demonstrate minor degenerative changes in the \nthoracolumbar spine. Soft tissues are unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nNo evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. No significant change \nin the appearance of bibasilar consolidation or prominent stool \nfilled colon compared to one day earlier.\n----\n\nUE u\/s [**1-14**]\n\nLEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler \nultrasound of the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, \nbrachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was performed. There is \nnormal flow, compressibility, waveforms, and augmentation. No \nintraluminal thrombus is identified.\n\nIMPRESSION: No left upper extremity DVT.\n\n----\nLAST HEAD CT [**1-25**]\nFINDINGS: Since the prior study, there has been evolution of the \nmultifocal right greater than left bilateral areas of \nintraparenchymal hemorrhage. The extent of cerebral edema \nappears unchanged. The ventricles are not dilated. The basal \ncisterns are patent. No new areas of hemorrhage are visible. \nChanges in the right frontal bone related to the craniotomy are \nstable. The mastoid air cells are opacified bilaterally, as \nbefore. Fluid and\/or secretions layer within the ethmoid and \nsphenoid sinuses bilaterally, also unchanged.\n\nIMPRESSION: No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage. Similar \nextent of brain edema compared to the prior study.\n\nLast CXR [**1-27**]:\nThere is probable cardiomegaly, with an unfolded aorta. No CHF \nor effusion is identified. There is patchy opacity in right and \nleft infrahilar regions. While this may represent atelectasis, \ninfectious infiltrates cannot be excluded. Allowing for \ndifferences in positioning, the appearance is unchanged compared \nwith [**3208-1-25**]. Tracheostomy tube noted.\n\nLast EEG [**1-17**]:\nFINDINGS:  \nPUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none. \nAUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTIONS: There were two. Neither of these \nrepresented a true electrographic seizure. \nAUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTIONS: There were 1,000 entries in these \nfiles. \nMost were artifactual but some right frontal and bifrontal sharp \nwaves \nwere seen. \nROUTINE TIME SAMPLING: Showed a slow and disorganized background \n\nthroughout most of the recording mostly in the delta and theta \nfrequency \nranges. Frequent and nearly continuous polymorphic delta \nfrequency \nslowing was seen focally in the bifrontal regions throughout \nmuch of the \nrecording and mixed alpha and beta frequency activity was seen \nbifrontally, as well. \n[**Doctor Last Name **]: No clear state changes were seen. \nCARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm. \nIMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no \npushbutton \nactivations. No electrographic seizures were seen. Interictally, \n\nhowever, right frontal and bifrontal epileptiform discharges \nwere seen. \nThe background was very slow and disorganized throughout the \nrecording, \nsuggestive of a moderate encephalopathy, and focal slowing in \nthe \nbifrontal regions suggested the additional possibility of \nsubcortical \ndysfunction in frontal lobes. \n  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n1.Neuro:The initial etiology of the patient's problems was not \nclear.  The initial priority was to control her seizures.  This \nwas accomplished using dilantin, phenobarbital, and a propofol \ndrip.  She was monitored during this propofol coma on a \ncontinuous EEG and burst suppression was achieved.  She had no \nfurther clinical evidence of seizure.  A extensive work-up \nincluded a repeat MRI showing numerous bilateral apparently \nischemic areas as well as multiple microhemorrhages.  All of \nthis was in the anterior circulation, with no posterior \ninvolvement.  An MRV showed no evidence of venous sinus \nthrombosis which had been suspected initially.  An MRA did not \nsuggest any pathology.  A repeat MRA which was deemed a better \nstudy was equally unhelpful in establishing a diagnosis.  \nPossibilities for her multiple areas of restricted diffusion on \nMR included the sequelae of prolonged status epilepticus, \ninfectious encephalitis, non-infectious encephalitis\/vasculitis, \nmultiple embolic strokes, segmental vasospasm.  An LP was done \nwhich showed 6 WBCs(monocytes and lymphocytes), 1 RBC, normla \nprotein and glucose. This was sent for a number of infectious \nagents which all returned negative(HSV,VZV,CMV,EBV,Crypto, \nvial\/fungal\/bacterial cultures).  Oligoclonal bands were also \nnegative.  While these studies were pending, she was continued \non broad spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir.  She was also put \non 4 days of pulse dose solumedrol given the possibility of \nvasculitis and then switched to prednisone 60 mg daily for \nseveral weeks.  The ID service was consulted and agreed with the \nabove studies.  She was intermittently febrile, often to \ntemperatures of 104.  The source was investigated thoroughly \nmultiple times and she was intermittently on various \nantibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl.  \nShe had a possible pneumonia at one point.  TLENIs were negative \nfor DVT, but a CTA of the chest revealed a large PE. Drug fever \nwas considered, especially to Dilantin, but this was a diagnosis \nof exclusion.  She continued to spike intermittent fevers during \nher course.  These were investigated each time with blood, \nurine, and sputum cultures.  Her sputum grew yeast multiple \ntimes, but per the ID service, this was considered a respiratory \ncontaminant.  At the time of discharge, she had completed a \ncourse of vancomycin and continued to have either low-grade \ntemperatures or fevers to 101.  These were not felt by \ninfectious disease to represent a specific source of infection, \nand cultures continued to be negative.\n\n  In further working to rule out causes of her condition, \nvasculitis was considered. She was on steroids as above. A brain \nbiopsy was undertaken which showed no evidence for vasculitis or \nany evidence for inflammation in general, but did show extensive \namyloid angiopathy.  Her case was discussed with many of the \nsenior staff and there was no clear consensus as to the cause \nand how amyloid angiopathy could be related to ischemic injury.  \nThere are case reports suggesting that amyloid can cause \nvasculitis leading to infarction but the biopsy results as \nstated did not support vasculitis.  Non-inflammatory \nvasconstriction syndromes were also entertained but this \ncondition would not be explained by amyloid angiopathy.  \nNevertheless, she was placed on calcium channel blockers as \nwell.  Eventually, as her blood pressure continued to be \ntenuous, the calcium channel blocker was discontinued (after at \nleast two weeks of therapy) with no substantial difference in \nher neurological state\/function.  However, Verapamil was \nrestarted at 80 mg by G-tube bid near the end of hospitalization \nbecause her blood pressure was more stable (with SBP 110s-140s). \n  \n    Multiple emboli were considered.  A TTE and then a TEE were \nperformed.  They showed no clear source of a proximal embolus \nthat may have caused a shower of embolic phenomenon.  She did \nhave a small PFO, but nothing significant enough to account for \nher symptoms.  \n      She was quickly weaned from the propofol after ~1 week and \nhad no new seizure activity on the EEG.  However, despite being \noff of all sedating medications for a prolonged time, she did \nnot regain consciousness.  The reason for this was not fully \nknown, but was presumed to be due to the extensive damage she \nhad suffered from the initial insult.  Despite multiple \ntherapeutic approaches, she continued to show new areas of \nrestricted diffusion on MRI.\n       Later in the hospitalization, a repeat CT scan to assess \nfor progression showed an increase in cerebral edema, thought to \nbe due to natural progression of her multiple strokes.  She was \nbriefly placed on mannitol, decadron, hypothermia and a \npentobarbital coma.  A repeat scan was improved and she was \ntaken off of the above therapies slowly.\n  There were several episodes of shivering\/shaking that did not \nappear to be seizures by EEG, but were concerning clinically.  \nShe had several EEGs with attempts to characterize these events, \nwhich later included nystagmoid eye movements that were \nbidirectional on forward\/resting gaze, with occasional gaze \ndeviation to either the left or right.  EEG showed no \nelectrographic correlate.  The epilepsy specialists felt that \nthe eye twitching was likely to be peripheral\/muscle activity \nrather than seizure, or perhaps a myoclonic equivalent.  She was \ncontinued on dilantin and reloaded on multiple occassions.  She \nwas also on phenobarbital, but as her LFTs rose, the epilepsy \nconsultants recommended switching to Keppra, which is renally \ncleared.  Keppra was titrated up to goal dose of 1500mg bid, and \nat that point, Phenobarb was to be weaned by 40 mg every two \ndays, with careful attention to the dilantin level (which should \nbe checked at least every other day), as this can rise suddenly \nas phenobarbital is decreased.  Corrected dilantin levels were \ntherapeutic at the end of her admission.  Her exam at discharge \nwas stable over one week - eye blinking and nystagmoid movements \nas noted above, occasional shivering-like movement of the right \nor left arm, sometimes in response to noxious stimuli and more \noften spontaneously.  She withdrew very slightly to deep noxious \nstimuli in her lower limbs, and grimaced (and once opened eyes) \nto deep sternal rub.  Reflexes were brisk throughout, and both \ntoes were upgoing.  At the time of discharge, she had no \ndirected responsiveness and blinked non-purposefully and not to \nthreat.  Brainstem reflexes were intact.  There were no \nmovements of her limbs and toes were bilaterally upgoing.  The \nbiopsy showed that she had extensive loss of neocortical \nneurons.\n\n2.Heme: She had a slowly drifting hematocrit initially that \nstabilized on its own.  However, after receiving heparin for her \nPE, she had a significant hematocrit drop.  This was \ninvestigated by a torso CT which showed no obvious source of \nbleeding.  Her hematocrit then stabilized.  It is unclear where \nthis lab abnormality originated.  She continued to have low but \nstable hematocrit levels, probably due to her chronic illness.  \nSe received several units of packed red blood cells, with some \nmild improvement of her hematocrit.  As she diuresed, her \nhematocrit increased, leading the team to believe that the \nanemia was perhaps partly dilutional.  For the last week of \nadmission, the hematocrit was stable, in the 27-30 range.  She \nwas also taken off the heparin drip two weeks prior to admission \nbecause of increased bleeding in the brain.  She underwent IVC \nfilter placement to prevent recurrence of PEs; the risks of \nremaining on heparin were considered to be greater than the \nbenefit to her PE.  For further prophylaxis, she was started on \nsubcutaneous heparin injections and pneumoboots.\n\n3.CV: She initially had fairly good blood pressure and heart \nrates.  She then developed tachycardia and hypotension, \nrequiring multiple fluid boluses and eventually pressors for BP \nsupport.  At this time, her PE was discovered and felt to be the \ncause of her hemodynamic instability.  This was treated with \nheparin and thrombectomy was considered.  The IR service was \nconsulted but felt that this was too risky a procedure at this \ntime so it was not performed.  She continued to require pressors \nfor several days and eventually was taken off the calcium \nchannel blockers, as noted above.  Her blood pressure stablized \nand has been in the 120-140 range (systolic) since, with regular \nheart rate.\n\n4.Pulm: She was ventilated fairly easily until she developed her \nPE as aboe.  This was a large right main pulmonary artery \nembolus.  LENIs from the day before were free of DVT, but it is \npossible that her clot came from a pelvic vein.  As above, she \nwas treated with heparin.  This was briefly off given her \nhematocrit drop, but was restarted when her levels stabilized \nand no sourceof bleeding was identified.  When she was \nstabilized, an IVC filter was placed.  She alternated between \nCMV and pressure support as an inpatient.  At discharge, she was \non PSV with a pressure of 12, PEEP 10, on 40%FIO2 achieving \nadequate tidal volumes for her size.\n\n6.Renal: Her urine output and renal function were stable \nthroughout her stay despite multiple possible nephrotoxic \nmedications.  She was initially net positive and developed \nanasarca (though was thought to be intravascularly depleted); \nduring the last few weeks of her hospital stay, she diuresed [**2-4**] \nto 1 L per day, with improvement of both the hematocrit and \nappearance of anasarca.\n\n7.ID: As above, she spiked multiple fevers for the majority of \nher stay here.  An infectious source was sought aggressively \ngiven the fact that she was on steroids and therefore \nimmunosuppressed.  No obvious source was found in her blood, \nurine, sputum, or CSF.  Other considerations were her PE and \npossible drug fever.  Other than contaminant yeast, no clear \nanswer was found for her fever.  In addition, her WBC count was \nnormal for much of her stay, but this was clouded by the \nsteroids she was receiving.  As mentioned above, her sputum grew \nyeast multiple times, but per the ID service, this is always a \nrespiratory contaminant.  She had completed a course of \nvancomycin and continued to have either low-grade temperatures \nor fevers to 101.  These were initially not felt by infectious \ndiseases to represent a specific source of infection, and \ncultures continued to be negative.  However, nearer the end of \nher hospital course, the sputum grew gram positive cocci and the \nwhite blood cell count went up; with these factors (as well as \nfever) she was started on a course of Vancomycin to treat a \npresumed tracheobronchitis (versus pneumonia - as chest xray \nshowed bilateral hilar infiltrates vs atelectasis).  Another \npossibility for her infection source was thought to be c-diff; \nstools were somewhat loose daily but not liquid.  CDiff toxin \nwas sent and was still pending at discharge.  However, the \nvancomycin (though not PO\/Gtube) should also treat this type of \nstool infection.  The white count went down, and she was less \nfebrile 24 hours after starting the vancomycin.\n\n8. Per ongoing discussions with her family (and per their \ndiscussions with the patient that predated this admission), she \nremains full code.  She was discharged to a rehab facility for \nfurther vent weaning.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n-MVI\n-cholesta\n\nUpon transfer from OSH:\n-dilantin 100mg 4 times daily\n-propofol\n-ativan PRN\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

A noncontrast CT scan was negative.  \nShe was given vancomycin, continued on ceftriaxone (2 g iv q12h) \nand acyclovir.  An LP revealed an opening pressure of 380 (?mm). \n WBC 988, RBC 45.  Differential on WBC was 58 PMNs, 25 lymphs, \n17 monos.  Gram stain negative for bacteria.  Glucose 80, \nprotein 167.  She also received Dexamethasone 10 mg IV given the \nmeningitis.  She continued to have deviation of her eyes as well \nas lip smacking, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 13**] on the \nNeurology\/SICU service on [**2905-8-4**] for further management.\n\nShe was evaluated by Neurology on arrival who felt she had \nencephalomeningitis and recommended an MRI.  She was intubated \nfor her mental status.  At that time, she was on dilantin, \npropofol, and ativan gtt.  She continued to seize (w\/occasional \ndecerebrate posturing, downward eye deviation) and was loaded \nwith depakote.  The MRI demonstrated enhancement of medial \ntemporal lobes, caudate, and thalamus bilaterally and \nsymmetrically.  MRV was negative for thrombosis.  She had a CT \nscan of her sinuses (given hx of otitis) which revealed mucosal \nthickening but no evidence of sinusitis, as well as a 5 mm dense \nsoft tissue mass which appeared to be adherent to her left \ntympanic membrane, of unclear significance.  She was continued \non the aforementioned antibiotics and ampicillin was added.

There is \ncorresponding abnormal signal on the diffusion- weighted \nsequences in these regions. An accompanying ADC map is not \navailable to distinguish true slowed diffusion from T2 shine- \nthrough effect. There is no susceptibility artifact or abnormal \nbright T1 signal to suggest hemorrhage. The brain parenchyma \ndemonstrates otherwise unremarkable signal intensity. The \nventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable. No definite \nenhancement is noted in the areas of signal abnormality on the \npost gadolinium-enhanced sequences.\n\nMR [**First Name (Titles) 5871**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5870**]: The venous sinuses demonstrate no evidence \nof thrombosis.

Possible etiologies include viral, \nHerpes, and Listeria encephalitis; less likely a paraneoplastic \nsyndrome. Correlate with clinical symptoms and lumbar puncture \nresults.\n2) No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.\n\nCT: FINDINGS: There is mild mucosal thickening of the maxillary, \nethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses. There are no air-fluid levels or \narea of osseous destruction. There is more polypoid focal \nthickening in the right maxillary sinus likely representing a \nretention cyst. The mastoid processes and air cells are clear. \nThere is a small amount of cerumen in the right external \nauditory canal but no evidence of an infectious process. \nCentered on the left tympanic membrane is a focal, circular, \nhyperdense soft tissue mass. It is difficult to definitively \nlocalize this soft tissue mass; however, it appears adherent to \nthe tympanic membrane within the middle ear rather than within \nthe external auditory canal. There is a trace amount of \nfluid\/soft tissue adjacent to it. There is no associated osseous \ndestruction. The dentition and remaining osseous structures are \nunremarkable. The orbits appear normal. The visualized brain \nparenchyma is unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1) No evidence of mastoiditis.\n\n2) Sinus polypoid and mucosal thickening without evidence to \nsuggest acute sinusitis.\n\n3) 5mm focal, dense soft tissue mass, which is difficult to \ndefinitively localize but appears adherent to the tympanic \nmembrane within the middle ear. This finding is of unclear \netiology and significance, and does not appear likely to \nrepresent the source of the patient's clinically suspected \nencephalomeningitis. There is no associated osseous destruction. \nAfter treated for the acute process, an ENT consult may be \nhelpful.\n\nCXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process. ETT at thoracic inlet.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe pt was admitted to MICU on [**2905-8-5**] from the SICU service.  \nThe following summarizes her MICU course (for SICU course, see \nHPI).  She was admitted on an Ativan gtt, as well as depakote \nand dilantin.  She continued to seize through this regimen, \ndespite reloading with both the dilantin and depakote.  She was \nthen placed on phenobarbitol (loading dose and daily dosing).  \nShe was continued on the same antibiotic regimen (ceftriaxone, \nvancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir).  ID felt that the most \nlikely diagnosis was EEE given the clinical scenario and MRI \nfindings.  Unfortunately, the only treatment for this is \nsupportive care.  She continued to spike temperatures.  On \n[**2905-8-6**], she began to have worsening hypernatremia.  She became \nprogressively hypotensive requiring pressors, including \nnorepinephrine and phenylephrine.  Her head CT revealed cerebral \nedema.  She was given mannitol and an intracranial pressure \nmonitor was placed.  Her sodium continued to rise, to >180.  A \nfamily meeting was held and the goals of care were changed to \ncomfort measures only, given the poor prognosis of her \nencephalitis.  She was extubated, placed on a morphine drip, and \ndied peacefully with her family by her side.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on transfer:\nAtivan gtt at 4 mg\/hr\nPhenytoin 100 q8h\nDepakote 250 q8h\nCeftriaxone 2 g IV q12h\nAmpicillin 2 g IV q6h\nVancomycin 1 g IV bid\nAcyclovir 500 IV q8h\nProtonix\nSQ heparin\nInsulin SS\nCipro ear gtt\n \nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nEncephalitis (likely Eastern Equine)\n \nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nnone\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nnone\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1226**] MD [**MD Number 1227**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 589**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4387**] MD [**MD Number 4388**] [**2905-8-8**] @ 2050\nSigned electronically by: DR.

She was emergently intubated, had admitted\nfrom the emergency department to [**Hospital1 550**] CCU.\n\nThe patient was noted to have ST elevations with her rapid\nrate which cleared when her rate was adequately controlled\nwith beta-blockers.  However, later that evening she\ndeveloped sinus bradycardia.  This is a known response in the\npatient to administration of beta-blockers.\n\nIn the CCU she was diuresed with resolution of respiratory\ndistress, CKMB fraction was positive but Troponin I was\nnegative.

Awake, alert,\nmouthing words appropriately.  Mucosa dry.  Heart rate rhythm\nregular, no murmurs.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally\nand superiorly.  Scattered expiratory wheezes.  Abdomen soft,\nnontender, nondistended.  Rectal exam:  Heme negative.\nExtremities had 1+ edema.  She was alert and oriented times\nthree and her neurological exam was grossly nonfocal.\n\nLABORATORY:  On admission initial white count 202, hematocrit\n38.1, platelets 351, sodium 141, potassium 5.0, chloride 104,\nbicarbonate 24, BUN 52, creatinine 1.5.

ST changes noted above had\nresolved.\n\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 9181**] was initially\nintubated, admitted to the CCU as detailed in above note.\nAlthough her resuscitation status was DNR\/DNI this was not\nnoted at this time and she was inadvertently intubated.\nWhile in the CCU she was rapidly extubated.\n\nThere was an initial concern for cardiac ischemia with the\nelevated CKMB fraction in the absence of Troponin I\nelevation.  This was thought to be consistent with an enzyme\nleak secondary to strain.  She was seen by covering\nphysicians for her primary care cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and\ndecision was made not to pursue further interventions or\nworkup at this time.  Initially her rate which was very rapid\nand probably precipitated her decompensation was controlled\nwith beta-blockers.  However, she did not tolerate this well\nalthough it initially decreased her rate allowing for\ncontrol.  She then became bradycardiac.  Upon further review\nthe patient had apparently done this in the past.  However,\nthrough the rest of her admission her rate remained well\ncontrolled without the use of beta-blockers.\n\nCongestive heart failure that she initially suffered\nsecondary to her rapid rate was thought to be from flash\npulmonary edema, responded well to diuresis at the time of\nthis dictation she is sating well on room air and able to\nambulate comfortably without desaturation.\n\nHer chronic renal insufficiency was stable with a creatinine\nof 1.5 which was close to her baseline.  This did not change\neven with aggressive diuresis following her pulmonary edema.\n\nShe was continued on her asthma medications while in house\nusing our formulary substitutions, Montolucast,\nBetamethasone, Albuterol MDI.  She had no asthma\nexacerbations while in house.\n\nHer initial white count was elevated over 200 however, this\nsubsequently declined to less than 100 with no interventions.\nIt was thought this initial laboratory was actually spurious\nand that her white count was below 100 which is near her\nbaseline.  At the time of discharge her last white count was\n97.  No further workup or intervention was taken at this time\nand she can follow-up as an outpatient with her own\nhematologist.\n\nA physical therapy consult was requested to evaluate her for\nhome safety.  Their recommendations were that she could\nreturn home but would require home physical therapy to\nincrease her functional mobility balance and endurance.  Our\ncaseworkers will assist in arranging this.\n\nThe patient does have baseline anemia and given her enzyme\nleak she was transfused with one unit of packed red blood\ncells for a hematocrit of 28.7.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.

He was transferred \nto the ICU in stable condition.  He was slow to awake but was \nfollowing commands on POD#1, and was extubated on POD#2. He was \ntransferred to the regular floor on POD#3.  He developed rapid \natrial fibrillation on POD#4.  He was found to be hypoxic with \nlabored breathing.  He was transferred back to the ICU and \nrequired reintubation.  Bronchoscopy showed copious secretions \nwhich showed oropharyngeal flora.  He was extubated on POD#6.  A \npulmonary consult was obtained and it was recommended to use \nintermittent BiPAP and diuresis.  He underwent therapeutic \nthoracentesis of the right chest on POD#8, and still required \nintermittent BiPAP to maintain adequate ventilation. On POD# 9 \nhe was noted to have a swollen left upper extremity and an \nultrasound showed thrombus in the left internal jugular and left \nsubclavian.  He was started on heparin for anticoagulation.  He \nunderwent thoracentesis of the left chest on POD#10.  On POD#12 \nhe was re intubated for worsening respiratory status and \nrespiratory acidosis with mental status changes.  A neurology \nconsult was obtained and he had a CT scan and MRI which were \nnegative for any acute process, as well as an EEG which was \nnegative for any seizure activity, and showed mild diffuse \nslowing consistent with encephalopathy.  It was thought that the \nmental status changes were due to metabolic encephalopathy, he \nwas started on Coumadin.  On POD#15 a pulmonary medicine consult \nwas again obtained and it was recommended that the patient be \nallowed to have a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, and continue \nBiPAP and aggressive pulmonary toilet.  He was again extubated \nand required almost continuous BiPAP to maintain adequate \nventilation.  It was determined that the patient would benefit \nfrom a tracheostomy and he was electively re intubated prior to \nthe procedure and underwent percutaneous tracheostomy on POD#20. \n Pulmonary medicine recommended continuing empiric antibiotics \nfor a presumed ventilator associated pneumonia. He was noted to \nhave a L inguinal hernia that was un reducible.  A general \nsurgery consult was obtained and and it was decided that no \nintervention was needed at this time.

Initially pt was on \ncisatricuium and fentanyl for sedation and paralyzation.  Pt was \nnever able to be completely off sedation due to intubation. Pt \nwas eventually taken off paralytic. Pt did move all extremities, \nbut true neurologic cognitive fuction could not be assessed \nthroughout his course.  Pt did grimace to pain.\nCV: Pt initailly presented to [**Hospital1 33**] on multiple pressors. Early, \nduring his course these pressors were rapidly weened. However, \nthroughout his course the pt needed continual low dose pressor \nin order to maintain adequate MAP.  It had been reported \nTroponin levels as high 100 at [**Last Name (un) **], upon arrival at [**Hospital1 33**] \ntroponin levels were aprox 9, which were elevated to as high as \n14 at one point.  Cardilogy was consulted. Echo showed some \nhypokinesia.  It was determined that the pt had a fair amount of \ncardicac insult and based upon initial Swan Ganz cath numbers \nshowed cadiac insufficiency which improved overtime. However, \nthe patient eventually went into overwhelming sepsis, worsening \necho results, and eventual cardiac failure. Near the end of the \npts course he was on multiple pressors and rquired cpr which was \nunsucessful\n\nResp: pt arrived at [**Hospital1 33**] with severe respiratory failure that \nrequired Nitric Oxide and well as paralyzation with \ncisatricurium and maximal Fio2 and ventilatory settings. Pt was \neventually weened off meds, and decreased vent setting. however, \ndue to continued resp failure the pt underwent percutaneous \ntrachestomy on [**9-30**]\n\nGI: Pt had know hepatic dysfunction Craigler-Nijar with know \nelevated direct bilirubin.  However pt was in shock liver upon \narrival to [**Hospital1 33**] with elevated trasaminases in the 1000's. Pt \nunderwent RUQ u\/s which showed no abnormalities other than \nascites. Pt underwent CT scan whcih showed a large likely \nnecrotic hematoma which was initially sucessfully drained by IR. \nNear the end of the patients hospital course , the pt became \nrapidly septic and it was noted that the drin had decreased \noutput. The decision was made that the likely septic source was \nthe hematoma nd teh decision was made to reoperate, at which \ntime frank pus was found ( please see op note for further \ndetails)\nGU: A primary reason the pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 33**] was due to \nunresolving renal failure, acidosis requiring CVVHD.  Upon \narrival a renal dialysis cath was palced and CVVHD was begun.  \nThe patients acidosis, BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes \nimproved over the subsequent days. And the patient did make a \nfair amount of urine. Near the end of the pts hospital course \nwith ensuing sepsis and increased pressor requirements the urine \noutpu dropped off\nHeme: Pt Hct was essentially stabe throughout the hospital \ncourse. Initially the pt had a mild coagulopathy that was \ncorrected with FFP.\nID:Initally the pt was on broad coved antibiotics though no true \nsource could be found. on [**9-26**] E Coli bacteremia was noted in \nblood cultures and appropriate antibiotics were adjusted for \ncoverage.The worsening sepsis was attributed to the frank \nperitoneal abscess found at the time of exploration\nFEN: The patients electrolytes were intially irregualr due to \nARF, however, they were quicklky corrected with CVVHD. \nAdditionally, TPN was begun after initail sepsis had improved as \nwell as slow tube feeds for enterocyte viability \n \nMedications on Admission:\nneuro: fentanyl, cisatricurium\nresp: nebulizing treatmens Albuterol\nCV: levophed, vasoprerssin\nGI: Protonix\nID: vanc, meropenum\nHeme: Heparin subcutaneously\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nsepsis, multisystem organ failure, death\n \nDischarge Condition:\ndeath\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2947**] MD [**MD Number 2948**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 388**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MD [**MD Number 10976**] [**3114-10-11**] @ 1119\nSigned electronically by: DR.

ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  It is still\n   unclear what may have been the precipitating factor\n   bringing on the patient's acute-on-chronic renal\n   insufficiency.  There is some debate whether it could have\n   been caused by the patient's overuse of sedatives such as\n   Ambien and narcotics for his back pain and [**Doctor Last Name 69**]\n   disturbance that caused hypotension and mental status\n   changes leading to hypoperfusion of the kidneys leading an\n   acute insult.  It is also possible that the patient may\n   have had a primary cardiac cause with a decompensated\n   congestive heart failure leading to poor forward flow and\n   acute-on-chronic renal failure.\n\nThe patient had a very high creatinine, acidosis, and\nhyperkalemia on admission which slowly resolved during the\ncourse of his hospital stay.  Initially, for the patient's\nhypotension the patient was placed on a dopamine drip to\nincrease perfusion.  The patient was not dialyzed given the\nfact that his INR was so high and line access could not be\nobtained with such a high INR.\n\nThe patient was initially put on a dopamine drip, and this\ntitrated off as his urine output continued to improve.\nInitially, the patient was also placed on a dose of Lasix 80\nmg intravenously q.8h., and his urine output improved so\ndramatically that the patient began auto diuresing several\ndays into his hospital course.\n\nGradually, with the improvement of his urine output and his\nauto diuresis the patient's electrolytes began to improve.\nFor his hyperkalemia, the patient was given Kayexalate times\ntwo doses, and his potassium improved to normal levels.  The\npatient was also initially placed on Amphojel to decrease his\nphosphorous, and eventually with improvement of his renal\nstatus his phosphorous decreased, and the Amphojel was\nsubsequently discontinued.  Upon discharge, the patient's\ncreatinine had improved to the high 2s from as high as 6.4,\nand his electrolytes were within normal limits.\n\nThe patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with\nDr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3027**] [**Name (STitle) 3028**] on [**5-15**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3028**] will most likely\nreschedule this appointment at an earlier date as she\ndetermines).  The patient's Lasix was also restarted at 20 mg\ntwice per day per attending recommends and as outlined below.\n\n2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  Although the patient\n   initially appeared to be in congestive heart failure with\n   peripheral and pulmonary edema, after initial diuresis the\n   patient was saturating well on room air and had minimal\n   crackles on examination.\n\nThe patient had a repeat echocardiogram performed on [**4-10**]\nwhich showed a worsening systolic function with an ejection\nfraction of 35 to 40 percent, dilated left and right atrium,\nmoderately depressed left ventricular systolic function,\nsevere 4 plus mitral regurgitation, moderate-to-severe 3 plus\ntricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery\nhypertension.  No pericardial effusion.  Compared with the\nfindings of the prior report on [**3-17**], the mitral\nregurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were worse and the\npulmonary hypertension was new.\n\nThe patient was initially put on 80 mg of intravenous Lasix\nq.8h. along with a dopamine drip to increase forward flow.\nThe patient diuresed quite well to this regimen and was\nputting out as much as 2 to 3 liters per day.  The Lasix was\nsubsequently discontinued in the Intensive Care Unit, and the\npatient was allowed to auto diurese.  Subsequently, for the\nnext several days of his hospital course, the patient was\ndiuresing 1 liter per day or more.  Prior to his discharge,\nthe patient was put on a regimen of 20 mg of Lasix by mouth\ntwice per day per attending recommendations, and the patient\nseemed to be negative 512 liters fluid balance on this\nregimen.\n\nThe patient has also been followed by the Congestive Heart\nFailure Service in the past and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nwhile he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  It was the\nCongestive Heart Failure Service's impression that the\npatient was showing decompensated congestive heart failure,\nand it was their recommendation that when the patient's blood\npressure stabilized to restart Imd[**MD Number 3126**] hydralazine.  The\npatient's digoxin was initially held with his renal failure,\nbut as his creatinine began to improve and his blood pressure\nimproved, the patient was restarted on his digoxin prior to\ndischarge. The patient was also started on Imdur 10 mg by\nmouth three times per day and hydralazine three times per\nday.\n\nThe primary team also considered getting a repeat\nechocardiogram to evaluate the patient's worsened mitral\nregurgitation, but after speaking to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of the\nCongestive Heart Failure Service, it was decided that the\npatient would most likely benefit from this test as an\noutpatient when the patient was allowed to return completely\nto baseline.  For now, the patient will continue on Lasix 20\nmg by mouth twice per day with close followup, and pending\noptimization of his medical management the patient will\nlikely need a repeat echocardiogram in three to four weeks\nafter discharge.  His mitral regurgitation can then be more\nadequately interpreted as the patient will not be acutely\nfluid overloaded at that time.\n\n3. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was restarted\n   on his aspirin, Imdur, hydralazine, and digoxin.  The\n   patient's initial troponin leak was thought to be\n   secondary to his increased creatinine, and his enzymes\n   trended downward.  The patient had no electrocardiogram\n   changes consistent with myocardial infarction.\n\n4. MENTAL STATUS CHANGE ISSUES:  It was likely that the\n   patient had lethargy, likely multifactorial, from the many\n   medications that he was taking (Ambien and Percocet for\n   pain) as well as his uremia on presentation.\n\nThe patient had a head computer tomography without contrast\nwhich was negative for bleed.  The patient had all narcotics\nand benzodiazepines held, and his mental status improved with\nimprovement of his uremia and acidosis.  On discharge, the\npatient's mental status was at baseline and he was\nconversant, interactive, and alert and oriented times three.\nIt was recommended to the patient at that time that the\npatient should not resume the usage of his Ambien,\nbenzodiazepines, or Percocet unless absolutely necessary\nsince these most likely contributed to his hospitalization.\n\n5. ACIDOSIS ISSUES:  The patient presented with a mixed\n   disorder of respiratory and metabolic acidosis.  The\n   respiratory acidosis was thought likely secondary to a\n   depressed mental status.  The patient's sedating\n   medications were held.  He was encouraged to use\n   continuous positive airway pressure at night; although he\n   refused.  The patient's metabolic acidosis improved when\n   his creatinine improved and his renal failure resolved.\n\n6. ELEVATED INR ISSUES:  The patient's elevated INR was\n   thought to be most likely secondary to hepatic congestion\n   from congestive heart failure.  He was given by mouth\n   vitamin K as well as intravenous vitamin K and 2 units of\n   fresh frozen plasma to decrease his INR.  Gradually, as\n   his cardiac and renal status improved, the patient's INR\n   decreased to 1.5 on discharge.  The patient was restarted\n   on his outpatient dosage of Coumadin 2.5 mg at hour of\n   [**Doctor Last Name 69**], and the patient was to follow up as an outpatient\n   two days after discharge at [**Location (un) 3224**] for an INR check.  The\n   results were to be faxed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7661**] (his primary\n   care physician) who will adjust his Coumadin level\n   accordingly.\n\n7. DIABETES ISSUES:  The patient was continued on a sliding\n   scale while he was in house, and his fingerstick checks\n   remained within normal limits.  The patient did not take\n   insulin at home and is not on an oral glycemic regimen,\n   but his fingerstick glucose levels have been very well\n   controlled.\n\n8. THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES:  This was of unclear etiology.\n   Question of splenic sequestration.  The patient's\n   thrombocytopenia has been stable as an outpatient and has\n   actually been seen by Hematology who suggested to simply\n   follow the patient and his platelet count.\n\n9. OBSTRUCTIVE [**Doctor Last Name **] APNEA ISSUES:  The patient refused his\n   continuous positive airway pressure at night.\n\n10. DEPRESSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on his\n   Celexa.  He appeared more depressed as it came closer to\n   discharge; mostly regarding issues from his chronic\n   illness.  It was recommended that the patient continue on\n   his current Celexa dose at this time, but outpatient\n   psychotherapy may be beneficial to help the patient cope.\n\n11. PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was continued on Protonix\n   and a bowel regimen.\n\nCODE STATUS:  Full.\n\nNUTRITIONAL ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a\n   renal, diabetic, and cardiac diet.\n\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

Likely, she has other esophageal\npathology such as peptic strictures from longstanding\ngastroesophageal reflux disease.  In her initial course, she\nwas treated supportively with blood transfusion to keep the\nhematocrit greater than 30%, given her underlying coronary\nartery disease.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction via\nserial enzymes.  She was treated with empiric antibiotics\nincluding ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Following\nblood product support, she remained hemodynamically stable\nwithout further evidence of bleed.\n\nGiven her hemodynamic stability, the consultation with the\ngastroenterology service, a repeat EGD was felt not to be of\nutility on this admission, due to the inability to dilate in\nthe setting of this [**Doctor First Name 1148**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  Rather, a diagnostic\nEGD after four to six weeks of esophageal rest, with proton\npump inhibitor prophylaxis, will allow for better\nvisualization, and perhaps tissue diagnosis.

On\nevaluation, review of the cardiac catheterization films\nrevealed that the patient's inferior ejection fraction was\napproximately 20 percent.  Patient was taken to the operating\nroom on [**3347-3-27**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] where a coronary artery\nbypass graft times three with a LIMA to LAD and saphenous\nvein graft to diagonal and saphenous vein graft to OM.\nPlease see operative note for full details.  Total\ncardiopulmonary bypass time was 36 minutes, crossclamp time\n51 minutes.  Patient was transferred to the Intensive Care\nUnit on dobutamine infusion with good hemodynamics.  In the\noperating room by transesophageal echocardiogram the\npatient's ejection fraction was estimated to be approximately\n25 percent which improved to 40 percent post cardiopulmonary\nbypass plus the addition of inotropic support.  Patient was\nweaned and extubated from the mechanical ventilation on his\nfirst postoperative evening.  The dobutamine was weaned off\non postoperative day number one with continued good\nhemodynamics.  Patient was started on low dose Lopressor\nwhich he tolerated well.  On the night of postoperative day\nnumber one patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation with\nsubsequent hypotension.  Patient was given Lopresor and\namiodarone due to hypotension.  The patient was started on\nNeo-Synephrine.  During this patient did not have pulmonary\nartery catheter but signs of cardiac output were good.\n\nPostoperative day number two electrophysiology service was\nconsulted and the patient would undergo attempted EP\ncardioversion and anesthesia administered adequate sedation\nand cardioversion was attempted times three.  On the second\nand third attempts at 360 joules patient had two beats of\nsinus rhythm and subsequently returned to atrial\nfibrillation.  At that time it was decided to continue the\npatient on amiodarone and to attempt cardioversion at a later\ndate.

A renal consult was obtained for management of the\nhyponatremia with the laboratory data of the plasma\nosmolarity of 264 and a urine osmolarity of 352 it was felt\nthat the patient was having SIADH versus heart failure\nrelated ADH really.  He recommended fluid restriction and\nLasix administration as needed.  Patient's sodium slowly\nbegan to rise after declining on postoperative day three to\n126 and ultimately rose to 134.\n\nPostoperative day number three patient continued in atrial\nfibrillation requiring Ancef and continued on amiodarone\ninfusion.  Preliminary coagulation studies were checked.\nPrior to starting patient on heparin for anticoagulation it\nwas noted that the patient had an elevated PTT and\nexamination of prior laboratory data showed that the patient\nhad consistently had PTTs in the mid 50s.  Hematology consult\nwas obtained and on laboratory examination it was determined\nthat patient had a lupus anticoagulant and elevated\nanticardiolipin antibody titer.  In light of this it was\nrecommended that patient be started on heparin for\nanticoagulation as this patient made patient hypercoagulable\nand recommended as patient's PTTs were elevated factor 10A\nlevel should be followed.  Also on postoperative day number\nthree patient was taken by the electrophysiology service for\nimplantation of automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator.\nPatient had a [**Company **] AICD with DDD pacing facilities,\nmodel number 7289 implanted on [**3347-3-31**].  Patient\ntolerated this procedure well.  During the implantation of\nthe AICD patient was converted into sinus rhythm.\n\nOn postoperative day number seven it was found that patient's\nplatelet count was decreasing, had been 113 on postoperative\nday number five, had dropped to 79 on postoperative day\nnumber six and was 70 on postoperative day number seven.\nPatient had previously had a heparin antibody sent which was\nnegative.  However, repeat heparin antibody sent at the time\nwas subsequently positive and the heparin infusion was\ndiscontinued.  Per the recommendation of hematology patient\nwas started on lepirudin as well as Coumadin.\n\nOn postoperative day number eight patient went back into\natrial fibrillation, continued to require low dose Neo-\nSynephrine which was eventually weaned off on postoperative\nday number nine.  Patient had been started on beta blocker,\ncontinued on amiodarone and by postoperative day number nine\npatient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the\nregular side of the hospital.  Patient had converted from\natrial fibrillation to AV paced and after less than 24 hours\nof patient being on the lepirudin infusion and two doses of\nCoumadin patient was found to have a PPD greater than 150 and\nan INR of 2.2.  The lepirudin infusion was stopped and\nconsultation with the hematology service recommended if\npatient's INR remains greater than 2 to not restart the\nlepirudin infusion.  Physical therapy was working with the\npatient.  It was recommended patient would benefit from acute\nrehabilitation and by postoperative day 11 patient was taken\nto the electrophysiology laboratory for testing of the AICD.\nIt was found to be functioning properly.  By postoperative\nday number 11 patient was cleared for discharge to\nrehabilitation.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum 99.9, pulse 85,\nA sensed to be paced.

The patient had nausea with exertion.  No\nshortness of breath.  No diaphoresis.\n\nThe patient presented himself to an outside hospital and was\ngiven sublingual nitroglycerin with relief of his pain.  He\nhad an electrocardiogram that showed a normal sinus rhythm at\n70, with ST depressions in leads I, aVL, III, as well as V4\nthrough V6.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 392**] for potential catheterization.\n\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was chest pain free.\nThe patient was treated with aspirin.  The patient was\nstarted on a heparin drip, started on a nitroglycerin drip,\nand given hydralazine and intravenous Lopressor to control\nhis blood pressure as needed.\n\nThe patient's creatinine at that time was 3.4 which was\nwithin the patient's baseline.  The patient was given fluids\nto hydrate him prior to catheterization.   The patient had\nflat creatine kinases, but had a troponin leak as high as\n29.1.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient's past medical history is\nas follows)\n1.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery\nbypass graft in [**3030**].  The patient had a left internal\nmammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, a\nsaphenous vein graft to the diagonal, with a jump graft to\nthe first obtuse marginal.\n2.

History of benign prostatic hypertrophy.\n6.  History of Parkinson disease.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission were)\n1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\n2.  Atenolol 150 mg p.o. q.d.\n3.  Nifedipine 90 mg p.o. q.d.\n4.  Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d.\n5.  Hytrin 2 mg p.o. q.d.\n6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.\n7.  Epogen 4000 units subcutaneously ever week.\n8.  Iron as needed.\n9.  Quinine as needed.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   The patient was\nafebrile on admission.  The patient had a heart rate of 84,\nblood pressure was 194\/87, saturating 97% on 2 liters nasal\ncannula.  Generally, he was in no apparent distress.  Alert\nand oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat\nexamination revealed mucous membranes were dry.  The neck\nexamination was remarkable for jugular venous pressure up to\nthe level of his jaw.  His chest had decreased breath sounds\nlaterally on the right; otherwise, clear to auscultation\nbilaterally (anteriorly and laterally).  Cardiovascular\nexamination was unremarkable.   The abdomen was nondistended\nand nontender.  Extremity examination revealed the patient\nhad a right groin catheter in place with no hematoma and no\noozing.  He had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior\ntibialis pulses bilaterally and trace lower extremity edema\nbilaterally.  Neurologic examination was grossly nonfocal.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had\na white blood cell count of 11.7, hematocrit was 32.7, and\nplatelets were 158.  INR was 1.5 and partial thromboplastin\ntime was 79.1.  Electrolytes revealed sodium was 142,\npotassium was 4.8, blood urea nitrogen was 60, creatinine was\n3.4, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 21, and blood glucose\nwas 114.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE\/SYSTEM:  In short, this is a\n75-year-old male with coronary artery disease; status post\ncoronary artery bypass graft, who presented with recurrent\nangina and ST changes; now status post stent to the saphenous\nvein graft, return of ST segment to baseline, and currently\nchest pain free.\n\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:   (a)  Cardiac catheterization:\nCardiac catheterization revealed a right-dominant circulation\nwith a 50% left main coronary artery lesion, a totally\noccluded left anterior descending artery, a left circumflex\nwith diffuse disease to first obtuse marginal with\ncollaterals and a jump segment of saphenous vein graft.  The\nright coronary artery had a 30% ostial and mild diffuse\ndisease.  The saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal\nwas patent but had a 90% ulcerated lesion after first\ndiagonal which was stented.  The patient's left internal\nmammary artery to his left anterior descending artery was\npatent.\n\nIn the catheterization laboratory, the patient was found to\nhave a wedge of 31, with a pulmonary artery pressure of\n67\/27, and a cardiac index of 2.  The patient was transferred\nto the Coronary Care Unit status post catheterization for\ndiuresis and hydration.  Post catheterization\nelectrocardiogram was consistent with resolution of the\npatient's ST depressions.\n\n(b)  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was status post\nstent.  He had no further occurrence of his chest pain\nthroughout the course of his hospitalization.  He was\ncontinued on Integrilin status post catheterization for 18\nhours and then was started on aspirin and Plavix.  The\npatient was also started on Lipitor.\n\n(c)  Pump:  The patient had a normal left ventricular\nejection fraction but elevated wedge pressures.  The patient\nwas diuresed to the level that he could tolerate.  The\npatient was continued on his beta blocker and hydralazine for\nblood pressure control and afterload reduction.\n\n(d)  Rhythm:  The patient had an episode of wide complex\ntachycardia two nights after admission which required shock\nwith 200 joules before return to a normal sinus rhythm, and\nwas transiently intubated.\n\nStatus post shock, the patient was thought to be in\nmultifactorial atrial tachycardia or wondering atrial\npacemaker; depending on his rate.\n\nThe patient had an Electrophysiology evaluation.  He appeared\nto be in an organized atrial rhythm with periods of 2:1\nconduction and periods of 2:1 block.\n\nRe-evaluation of his rhythm strips from the episode of wide\ncomplex tachycardia suggested that this could have been\natrial tachycardia with 1:1 conduction rather than\nventricular tachycardia.\n\nHowever, the patient finally had an electrophysiology study\nwhich showed that his rhythm was atrial flutter which was\nmapped and ablated in the Electrophysiology Laboratory.  The\npatient remained in a sinus rhythm for the rest of his\nadmission.\n\n2.  RENAL SYSTEM:  Unfortunately, the patient had an increase\nin his creatinine and became oliguric.  This was evaluated by\nthe Renal Service and thought to be acute tubular necrosis\ndue to dye nephropathy.  The patient's creatinine peaked at a\nhigh of 5 and was trending down at the time of discharge, and\nwas in the 4 range.  The patient never had any indications\nfor acute hemodialysis.\n\n3.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient received 2 units of\npacked red blood cells during the course of his admission for\na hematocrit of less than 30 during acute coronary syndrome.\nThe patient's hematocrit was stable on discharge.\n\nThe patient was also restarted on Coumadin.   The patient had\none episode of scant hemoptysis, and his Coumadin was reduced\naccordingly.\n\n4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient developed\npneumonia on a chest x-ray and was started on levofloxacin\nwithout event.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged on\n[**3045-8-19**] in good condition.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\/FOLLOWUP:\n1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4236**] in\nCardiology.\n2.

On [**2674-11-20**], the rash had spread to\nher face and palms.  She did not have any shortness of breath\nat the time or any oral involvement, any chest pain, nausea\nor vomiting.  She was started on Benadryl and Claritin in\naddition to Hydrocortisone cream with little improvement.\nShe had recently been started on Captopril at the\nrehabilitation center and this reaction was thought to be due\nto the Captopril.  At approximately 8:00 p.m. on [**2674-11-20**],\nthe patient reported being diaphoretic and short of breath.\nHer oxygen saturation fell to 84% with heart rate elevated to\n160 beats per minute and her blood pressure was 250\/158.  The\npatient was noted to be very agitated and confused.\nElectrocardiogram was checked which showed sinus rhythm which\nwas tachycardic.  There were no acute ischemic changes.  Her\noxygen saturation improved to 97% on four liters nasal\ncannula.  The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 105**] Emergency Department where she was\nfound to be normotensive with a normal electrocardiogram.\nHer potassium was found to be elevated at 6.0 for which she\nwas given Kayexalate and after being on the bed pan became\nhypertensive again.

A trial of Clinoril was performed with no\nimprovement of the patient's fevers.  CH-50, C3, and C4 were\nalso done and were within normal limits.  A Rheum consult was\nasked.  Rheumatologist noted increased LDH of 1,522, ferritin\nof greater than 1,300.  Rheumatoid factor and [**Doctor First Name 155**] were\nnegative.\n\nPatient was subsequently extubated, though his pulmonary\nstatus remained tenuous.  Patient remained afebrile on\nnumerous antibiotics for 24 hours prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 671**].  Patient was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 104**] for workup of his fever\nof unknown origin and treatment of his pneumonia, Clostridium\ndifficile colitis, and urinary tract infection.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

Sodium 139, potassium 4.0,\nchloride 104, bicarbonate 26, BUN 16, creatinine 0.7, glucose\n121, LDH 1,522.  Numerous blood cultures, urine cultures, and\nsputums taken on admission.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care\nUnit service and a workup for fever of unknown origin ensued.\nPatient was continued on his aggressive treatment of a\nClostridium difficile colitis as well as his urinary tract\ninfection and his aspiration pneumonia with the current\nantibiotics.  Infectious Disease consultants followed the\npatient closely throughout his course.\n\nThe cause of his persistently high fevers were thought to be\nmost likely infectious, but given the patient's extremely\nhigh LDH levels and some lymphadenopathy noted on CT scan at\nthe outside hospital, the possibility of malignancy was also\nconsidered and Hematology\/Oncology consult was also\nrequested.  Patient subsequently had a whole body CT scan.\n\nCTA of the chest was a limited study due to the patient's\nhabitus, but revealed numerous mediastinal and hilar lymph[**MD Number **], multiple paratracheal lymph[**MD Number 112**], the largest of\nwhich was 1 cm in diameter.  There was also a 1.4 x 1 cm left\nhilar lymph node as well as a 1.2 x 1 cm right hilar lymph\nnode as well.  There were two large carinal lymph[**MD Number 112**]\npresent as well, and there were numerous nonpathologically\nenlarged bilateral axillary lymph[**MD Number 112**] as well.  There were\nareas of atelectasis within the left lower lobe, and there\nwas no evidence of pulmonary embolus on examination.\n\nCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a splenic infarct,\nwhich was known from outside hospital.  No intraabdominal or\nintrapelvic abscesses were identified and small bilateral\npleural effusions were noted.\n\nThe interpretation of these findings was difficult given the\nfact that patient had numerous infectious etiologies and\npossible malignancy.  Patient's numerous enlarged lymph[**MD Number 112**]\nwere thought to be consistent with a reactive process.  But\ngiven the possibility of malignancy, it was thought that\ntissue biopsy would be appropriate.  Unfortunately, the lymph[**MD Number **] were not amenable to percutaneous biopsy, and\nmediastinoscopy was thought necessary.\n\nThe patient's wife deferred mediastinoscopy given the\npatient's poor prognosis and worsening condition.\nCardiothoracic Surgery consultants were requested at this\ntime, evaluated the patient, but held off on any further\nworkup given the family's hesitation for invasive procedures.\n\nPatient also had an abdominal ultrasound performed to check\nfor any lymphangitic involvement of the liver given the\npatient's mildly elevated LFTs.  Ultrasound revealed an\nenlarged liver, but no focal masses were seen.  There was no\nevidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  No\npericholecystic fluid was seen, and it was thought to be a\nrelatively benign study.\n\nPatient also had a CT scan of the head performed given the\npatient's mental status change and given the patient's\nhistory of prostate cancer, and right MCA stroke, it was\ndesired to determine that there was no intracranial process\nthat was contributing to his condition.  CT scan revealed\nonly evidence of chronic infarctions involving the right\nanterior division of the MCA with a small posterior left\nfrontal infarction which were all thought to be old.  There\nwas no mass effect noted.\n\nPatient's condition continued to deteriorate, and patient\nremained febrile with fevers as high as 103 and 104 despite\nantibiotics.  Tylenol around the clock and cooling blankets.\nHematologists presented this patient's case at conference,\nbut without tissue biopsy, it was deemed impossible to make a\ndiagnosis of this condition.  Patient's numerous blood\ncultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures remained no\ngrowth to date.  The patient also had fungal cultures grown\nwhich were negative.  EBV and CMV studies were also done\nwhich were negative.\n\nPatient's sputums eventually returned 4+ gram-positive cocci,\n3+ gram-positive rods.  Was negative for Legionella.  Wound\nculture was positive for only 2+ PMNs.  SPEP and UPEP were\ndone and were negative.  PSA was noted to be less than 0.1.\nC3 and C4 were within normal limits.  Hepatitis panel was\nnegative.\n\nPatient continued to produce a tremendous amount of copious\nsecretions.  The patient was extubated for a short period for\n2-3 days despite his worsened condition and did fairly well,\nbut patient was quite tachypneic, and had respiratory\naccessory muscle use, and had to be rapidly reintubated.\n\nPatient's condition continued to deteriorate.  Family\ndiscussion ensued with the family, and they decided to make\nthe patient DNR\/DNI.  Patient continued to spiral downwards,\nand despite aggressive treatment of his MRSA bronchitis,\nClostridium difficile colitis, and Pseudomonal urinary tract\ninfection, his condition worsened.  Patient went into acute\nrenal failure which was probably secondary to poor\nhemodynamic function as well as a combination of a diload\nstatus post CTA.\n\nThe patient became hypotensive transiently and was responsive\nto normal saline boluses.  The Renal team joined the\npatient's numerous consultants and patient was placed on\npressors for the hypotension and patient was continued on D5\nhalf normal saline on bicarbonate with some improvement in\nrenal function, but arterial blood gas revealed the following\nnumbers:  7.03, 31, and 147 at that time.\n\nPatient became hypotensive on [**4-1**] down to 70\/40 with\npersistent tachycardia into 110s to 120s.  Given the family's\nrequest, that the patient be made comfort measures only.  The\npatient's dopamine drip and ET tube removed.  Patient\nsubsequently passed away at 5:15 am on [**3140-4-1**].  Patient's\nfamily request an autopsy to be obtained.\n\nAutopsy revealed numerous necrotic lymphadenopathy in the\nmediastinum as well as purulent material in bronchi\nbilaterally.  Microscopic analysis of the patient's lymph[**MD Number **] and liver revealed anaplastic lymphoma.\n\nPatient's family was made aware of these findings, and\nautopsy results were mailed to them twice, both preliminary\nand final results were mailed to them and discussed by Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] and myself.  Patient's family was comforted, and\nthe futility of the patient's case was discussed at length\nwith him given the patient's numerous infectious processes\nand malignancy, the patient's condition, and prognosis, the\npatient's condition and course were clearly explained to the\npatient, and they seem to take comfort in understanding the\nmechanism of his demise.\n\n\n                              [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.   [**MD Number 2280**]\n\n\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 4479**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**3140-6-3**]  22:23\nT:  [**3140-6-4**]  05:10\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 9483**]\n\n\nSigned electronically by: DR.

It was constant, on the left\nside of her head, throbbing.  The patient did not have any\nrecent head trauma.  A CT at an outside hospital showed\nchronic bilateral subdural hematomas.  The patient denied any\nsubjective weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria, nausea,\nor vomiting.  The patient was on Coumadin for deep vein\nthrombosis prophylaxis status post her right hip replacement\nwhich was done on 07\/2003.  On admission, the patient had an\nINR of 2.1 which was treated in the Emergency Room with four\nunits of fresh frozen plasma.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was awake, alert, oriented\ntimes three.  Her vital signs were 99.7 temperature, 66 heart\nrate, 132\/60 blood pressure, 19 respirations, and 95 percent\nsaturation in room air.  Her heart had a regular rate and\nrhythm.

Extraocular movements intact.  Facial sensation\nwas intact.  Her face was symmetric.  Her strength was full\nthroughout except for her right IP was 4+\/5, and we think\nthat was related to her hip surgery.  Sensation was grossly\nintact.  Her reflexes were 3+ bilaterally through both her\nupper and lower extremities.  Her gait was not tested.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her PT was 13.4, INR, which was taken after\nthe four units of fresh frozen plasma, was 1.2, white blood\ncount 5.8, hematocrit 30.6, platelets 256.  Sodium 140,\npotassium 3.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 27, BUN 13, and\ncreatinine 0.8.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive\nCare Unit for close observation.  Her CT on admission showed\na bilateral subdural hematoma, thickest at the left parietal,\nchronic appearance in nature.  There was no shift, no change,\nand no hydrocephalus noted.  Enhanced CT showed no obvious\nenhancement.  There was a question of a bony defect on her\nright parietal bone.  She was admitted to the Intensive Care\nUnit where her neurological signs were checked every hour.\nHer INR was corrected to keep it less than 1.4.  She was\ngiven vitamin K both in the Emergency Room and for three days\nwhile in the hospital.  Her systolic blood pressure was kept\nless than 160.  She was kept on bed rest and nothing by\nmouth.\n\nShe remained awake, alert, and oriented over night.  On\n[**2927-9-17**], her vital signs were stable.  Her INR was now\n1.0.

CVL lines placed and paracentesis performed for \nascites, transfused 2u PRBC, and begun empiric antibiotics.  GI \nconsulted and ERCP performed the following morning, finding the \nCBD stent in the duodenal lumen which was removed.  That \nafternoon, respiratory distress ensued with hypoxia, and the \npatient was intubated in the ERCP-PACU.  The abdomen was \ndistended and tympanitic, a KUB was concerning for localized air \nbut no free air.  Surgical consult from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Gold \n(hepatobiliary) service was obtained and, after extensive \ndiscussion with the family, decision was reached for exploratory \nlaparotomy for duodenal perforatoin from wall stent erosion, \nwhich was performed on [**Date range (1) 4835**] with a biliary bypass, repair \nof duodenal perforation.  She continued to require aggressive \nIVF resuscitation in SICU on the West Campus but overall was \nhemodynamically improved on moderate dose levophed.\nThe evening of POD 1 ([**2-24**]) was notable for an acute \ndesaturation into the 30's associated with hypotension into the \n50's.  Max'd pressors with large-scale IVF resuscitation.  ABG \nshowed worsening acidosis.  SVT into 200's ensued which \nconverted into sinus tachycardia in 120's.  A swan-ganz catheter \nwas utilized to guide management.  Clinical picture highly \nsuspicious and consistent with massive pulmonary embolus, but \nwas too unstable for radiographic confirmation.  Heparin drip \nwas begun empirically.\nNo further events ensued that evening as pressors remained at \nhigh levels, broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued, and net \npositive IVF resuscitation was required.  cc per cc replacement \nof high JP (ascites) output commenced.  Over the next few days, \nventilatory pressures were high and vent changed to \npressure-control ventilation.  Thrombocytopenia ensued, a HIT \nwas negative and heparin maintained throughout.  Hematocrits \nwere stable.  An echocardiogram on [**2-25**] demonstrated no \npericardial effusion.  With results from admission cultures, \nantibiotics were adjusted.  Trophic tube feeds begun.  With \nrising bilirubin, ultrasound revealed complete thrombosis of the \nportal vein.  A family meeting was held on POD 5 and she was \nmade DNR.  With worsening thrombocytopenia to 7, a hematology \nconsult was obtained, and she was transfused platelets.\nOn the morning on POD 9, she became hypotensive with falling \nhematocrit and worsening pressor and IVF requirement.  Some \nmucosal bleeding was noted.  After a lengthy discussion with the \nfamily, decision was reached to move to CMO care.

In their ED, he had melena \nand hematocrit of 21.4. His was markedly hypovolemic with Cr of \n1.8, BUN 88, SBP 95, HR:80. He never had gross bleeding but his \nHct failed to improve with transfusion. During his admission \nthere, he was transfused 12U PRBC and 4U FFP. He underwent an \nEGD twice, both times revealing large duodenal ulcer with \noverlying clot; intervention was not possible as the endoscopist \nfound it difficult to keep the scope in the duodenum. On \nadmission, [**6-4**], he was noted to be in NSR but ECG dated [**6-5**] \nshows him in atrial fibrillation. On the AM of transfer, he was \nnoted to be mottled and cold, clammy with HR in the 150s, BPs \n160\/110, tachypnic and with sats in the 70s. There was concern \nfor volume overload due to multiple transfusions vs. aspiration \npneumonia. He was intubated and given propofol for sedation; his \nBP dropped perhaps due to positive pressure ventilation vs. \npropofol. He was given neosynephrine for hypotension. He spiked \na fever to 103.3. Tanish secretions were noted coming from ETT. \nHe was placed on Zosyn but when PCN allergy was detected, he was \nchanged to levofloxacin. An OG tube was placed with drainage of \n400 cc of greenish-brown material. His left AC IV was noted to \nbe erythematous (?reaction to levaquin). He was given benadryl \nand the levaquin was discontinued. There was a long discussion \nwith the patient's wife (his healthcare proxy) about his goal of \ncare. She \"wanted to do everything possible to save his life.\" \nHis friends, who came to visit, however, stated that \"Mr. \n[**Name14 (STitle) 10025**] did not wish to have heroics done or any invasive \nprocedures.\" It was their impression that the patient's wife was \nsomewhat demented. The team decided to respect the wife's \nstatements as the patient's goals given that she is his proxy. \nAs his neo was being infused through a peripheral IV, a right IJ \nwas placed by the surgical service under sterile conditions. He \nwas transferred to the MICU on [**3395-6-9**] at [**Hospital1 19**] for management of \nGI Bleed and shock.  \n.  \nIn the [**Hospital1 19**] MICU, the right IJ was removed (based on the new \n[**Hospital1 19**] line policy that requires all lines placed at outside \nhospitals to be removed), and a left subclavian line was placed. \nHe was extubated as his oxygenation and ventilation were normal. \nHis neo was weaned off. GI was consulted to evaluate him. It was \ntheir impression that since his Hct was stable and he was known \nnot to have varices that they would not perform another EGD \nhere. They recommended bid IV PPI and vitamin K to reverse his \nVitamin K deficiency (likely nutritional). The patient's WBC \ncount on admission was 21 with 14% bands. He was placed on \nceftriaxone, vanco and flagyl empirically. The bandemia rose to \n24% on [**3395-6-10**]. He remained hemodynamically stable \npost-extubation, afebrile with lactate of 1.6. Cortisol level of \n20. All blood cultures were negative, with the exception of a \nsputum culture from [**6-9**] which grew gram negative rods. A TTE was \nperformed on [**6-10**] given the patient's afib, low voltage and \ntransient hypotension. The LVEF was 55%, 1+MR\/1+AR, LA was \ndilated. Trivial effusion. His Hct remained stable for 24 hours \nand was 28 on the day of transfer ([**6-12**]).  \n\n \nFLOOR COURSE [**6-12**] -> TODAY  \nUpon transfer, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10026**] from social work was consulted \nregarding confusion with code status. It was determined that the \npatient's wife was stated that his wanted all measures because \nshe was \"terrified that her husband would not come home to take \ncare of her.\" Patient also confirmed that he wished to remain \nfull code and have cardioversion and be reintubated if need \narose as he would always look forward to seeing his wife again. \nUpon arrival to the floor patient has no specific complaints and \nis very stoic. He is unclear of why he is in the hospital but he \ndoes know he is in [**Hospital3 **].

There are \nmural calcifications of the aortic arch. Multiple small lymph[**MD Number 761**] of the mediastinum are present in the paratracheal, \npretracheal and aorticopulmonary window regions measuring up to \n12 mm maximum. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. There is \nextensive consolidation of the left lower lobe as well as \nlingula and apex of the left upper lobe with associated air \nbronchograms consistent with pneumonia. There are large \nbilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe \nposterobasal atelectasis. Consolidation and air bronchograms of \nthe posterior right lower lobe are likely due to atelectasis. \nFluid also tracks into the fissures and peripheral interlobular \nseptae bilaterally. There are wedge- shaped pleural-based \nopacities of the right middle and right upper lobes which are \nlikely inflammatory, possibly spread of pneumonia, infarcts are \nmuch less likely. There are multiple small bilateral apical \nblebs. No pneumothorax. Limited evaluation of the abdomen \ndemonstrates an atrophic appearing pancreas but otherwise \nunremarkable limited views of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, \nand kidneys.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions \nare identified.

It \nwas felt that there was no indication for repeat intervention as \npatient's Hct remained stable.   His last transfusion was before \narrival to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**6-9**].   His discharge Hct is 28.8 and he \nappears to have settled in that range.  Patient is to continue \non Protonix BID in the meantime for his ulcer.  He is to avoid \nany anticoagulation for his afib.  He may require a repeat EGD \nif his Hct starts to drop or if he experiences hematemesis.\n.  \n2) Hypotension\/Shock - Now resolved. Most likely etiology was \nsepsis given bandemia with pneumonia as seen with lung \ninfiltrates.  +\/- hypovolemia due to blood loss. Patient \nsubsequently with hypertension.  Patient underwent cortisol stim \ntest and it was norm la, there was no evidence of adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Patient's BCx remained negative while in house.  \nHis UCx was unremarkable as well.  Patient finished 7 day course \nof IV CTX\/Flagyl while in house.  He is to complete 5 days more \nof Levoquin\/Flagyl PO.  \n.\n3) Hypoxia -\nPneumonia -\nPatient was found to have Klebsiella on sputum on [**6-9**] that was \npan-sensitive.  A CT done on [**6-13**] showed multilobular PNA that \nwas treated with 7 days of IV CTX\/Flagyl.  Patient is to \ncomplete another 5 day course of Levofloxacin at acute rehab.  \nInterventional Pulmonary service was consulted in house to \nattempt a diagnostic\/therapeutic thoracentesis.  The effusion \nwas visualized with US and a tap was attempted.  No fluid was \nextracted.  The procedure was without complication.  Follow up \nCXR was without pneumothorax.  Patient remained afebrile since \nafter his d\/c from ICU on [**6-12**] and his WBC remained normal.\n.\n? diastolic CHF - patient with E\/E' <8, thus suggesting PCWP \n<12, and EF > 55%, but patient does have 55%.  Patient was \nattempted at diuresis as his CT appeared to have b\/l pleural \neffusions and he was given prn IV lasix (20-40) prior to \ndischarge with good UO.  \n.\nPatient is sating 95%+ on 2L at the time of discharge.  However \ndesats quickly with little movement. \n- He would certainly benefit from pulmonary reevaluation at the \nend of his antibiotic course as his treatment course may need to \nbe extended for this complicated multilobar pneumonia. Continued \ndiuresis and rate control for chf will also likely be helpful. \n.  \n3) Afib- Appears new and likely secondary to medical conditions. \nLarge atrial size suggests that it will most definitely be \nrecurrent. Patient tolerated low dose BB well and remained well \ncontrolled with rate in 50-60s. \n.  \n4) R shoulder pain - patient states the pain has been there for \nlast few years.  CXR here showed no evidence of fracture, with \nsome suggestion of OA changes.  The high riding humerus may \nsuggest an underlying chronic rotator cuff injury that should \nperhaps be further evaluated by an orthopedic specialist - \nnonacutely.\n- tylenol\/oxycodone for pain\n.\n5) EtOH use:  no evidence of withdrawal despite use of 2-3 \ndrinks a day.\n>>> d\/c CIWA scale as patient with neglible scores, likely out \nof window.

Confluent airspace opacities within the right \nand left lower lung zones, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia or \naspiration.\n2. Right IJ catheter is seen, with a kink in the proximal most \nportion. \n.\nTIPS [**3408-10-25**]: 1) Portal hypertension with pressure gradient \nbetween the portal vein and hepatic vein measured 14 mmHg prior \nto formation of the portosystemic shunt. Large gastric varices \nwere demonstrated. 2) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic \nshunt placement and alcohol embolization of two large gastric \nvarices with good angiographic results was performed. The \npost-TIPS portosystemic pressure gradient was reduced to 9 mmHg. \n3) Placement of a 9-French 11 cm triple-lumen central venous \ncatheter via the right internal jugular vein with the tip in the \nSVC, ready for use.\n.\nECG [**3408-10-25**]: Sinus tachycardia; Modest diffuse nonspecific ST-T \nwave changes.\n.\nCXR [**3408-10-26**]: Increased opacification at the left lung base \nlikely represents worsening pneumonia or aspiration. Improved \naeration of the right lung base probably represents improving \natelectasis.\n.\nRUQ u\/s [**3408-10-26**]: The left portal vein is not visualized. There \nis hepatopetal flow within the main portal vein with velocities \nof approximately 15 cm\/sec. The TIPS is poorly visualized. There \nappears to be wall-to-wall flow velocities of approximately 37, \n60, and 76 cm\/sec returned from the proximal, mid, and distal \nTIPS respectively. The IVC is patent. There is no evidence of \nintra or perihepatic hematoma.\n.\nCT head [**3408-10-27**]: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal \nextra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift. The \nventricles and basal cisterns are unremarkable. The slightly \nlower attenuation of the left temporal lobe is thought to be \nartifactual given the slightly asymmetric positioning of the \npatient's head. There is no definite focal effacement in this \narea. Fluid in the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses is \nprobably secondary to endotracheal intubation.\n.\nCXR [**3408-10-27**]: Heterogeneous opacification at the right lung \nbase, which cleared between [**10-25**] and 16, has recurred. \nAlthough I cannot exclude pneumonia, the sequence of events more \nlikely reflects asymmetric edema accompanied by small bilateral \npleural effusions. Left lower lobe atelectasis persists. The \nheart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Tip of \nendotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet is more than 8 cm from \nthe carina, 4 cm above optimal placement. Tip of the right \njugular sheath projects over the SVC. No pneumothorax or \nmediastinal widening.\n.\nECG [**3408-10-27**]: Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic repolarization \nabnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**3408-10-25**] \nheart rate is slower. Otherwise, no major change.  \n.\nCXR [**3408-10-28**]: Consolidation in the lungs, particularly the left \nhas increased substantially since [**9-25**], having improved \nbetween 15 and 16. Some of this may be due to pulmonary edema \nbut worsening pneumonia, particularly in the left lung is \npresumed. Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin \nof the clavicles, more than 8 cm from the carina and 4 cm above \noptimal placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and \nout of view. Right internal jugular sheath projects over the \nexpected course of the right internal jugular vein, but is \nsharply folded proximally. There is at least a small left \npleural effusion. The heart is top normal size and unchanged. \nThere is no pneumothorax.\n.\n\n  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nA 45yoM with history of alcoholism presented with large amount \nof hematemesis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 25**] for actively \nbleeding gastric varices seen on EGD.\n.\n1. GI bleed: The Pt. was admitted with a history and LFT pattern \nconsistent with alcoholic liver failure\/cirrhosis.  The Pt. was \ntransfused with pRBCs for goal Hct>30.  The patient was started \non octreotide gtt, levofloxacin (per data showing benefit with \nesophageal varices) for 10 days, and IV protonix.  The patient \nwas evaluated by the liver\/gi service and underwent the TIPS \nprocedure.  Following the TIPS procedure, the Pt's hematocrit \nremained stable, and transaminases and NH3 trended down toward \nnormal levels, although bilirubin levels increased.  The patient \nhad an NG tube placed, and was treated with lactulose and \nrifaximin, and tube feeds were started on hospital day 4.  \n.\n2. Fever: The Pt. had persistent fevers upon admission.  \nInitially Pt. had no signs of infection, and neuro exam (pupils, \nextremity tone) was unchanged.  A head CT was negative.  Due to \nliver disease, Pt. was not treated with acetaminophen; instead a \ncooling blanket was used.  Due to concern for an aspiration \npneumonia, the Pt. was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin \non admission.  Fluid from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) grew 4+ \ngram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.  Vancomycin was added \nto the regimen for improved gram positive coverage.  \n.\n3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated upon admission \nfor airway protection, and maintained on assist control \nventilation with propofol sedation.  \nThe Pt's pCO2 was allowed to run around 55, and CPAP + pressure \nsupport trials were initiated, which the Pt. seemed to tolerate. \n By hospital day 4, the Pt. was off sedation, but still remained \nasleep and essentially unresponsive.  Fentanyl gtt was titrated \nto Pt. comfort while ETT tube was in place.\n.\n4. Hepatitis: Pt. was admitted with elevated LFTs, likely a \nresult of alcoholic cirrhosis, especially given transaminase \nratio AST:ALT > 2:1.  Presence of gastric varices points to \ncirrhosis.  The patient underwent the TIPS procedure and was \ntreated with rifaximin as above.  Viral and autoimmune \nserologies were negative for Hep B and Hep C but positive for \nHep A, and a ceruloplasmin level was found to be 16 (low).  \nFollowing the TIPS procedure, the Pt's LFTs normalized, however, \nthe bilirubin increased from 9.9 up to 25.4.  The etiology of \nthis was thought to be either TIPS-induced liver dysfunction vs. \npost-op jaundice and sepsis. On hospital day 7 the pt began to \nshow signs of acute renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome was \nconsidered likely, with the normalizing LFTs actually \nrepresenting loss of synthetic liver function.\n.\n5. Alcoholism: Pt's last alcoholic drink was [**10-23**].  \nTremulousness and tachycardia on admission were likely related \nto alcohol withdrawal.  The patient was treated with valium \n5-10mg Q1H:PRN dosed according to a CIWA Scale.\n.\n#. Psych: The Pt. has a history of depression, anxiety and \nsubstance abuse.  Urine toxicology on admission was positive for \ncocaine, though wife did not know about a history of drug abuse. \n Social Work and substance abuse were consulted and met with the \nPt. after he woke up.  He was also treated with a nicotine \npatch.\n.\n#. Tachycardia: Likely related to both active GI bleed and \nhypovolemia as well as alcohol withdrawal given concomitant \ntremulousness.  Initial management addressed hemodynamic \nstability and fluid resuscitation, and then the Pt. was treated \nwith nadolol, which has non-specific beta 1&2 blocking activity. \n \n.\n6. ARF: Creatinine normalized initially. Pt. was initially \nprerenal related to blood loss.  Cr normalized following \nfluid\/blood product resuscitation, and Is\/Os were monitored \nthroughout hospitalization. On hospital day 7, the Cr began to \nrise dramatically, and hepatorenal syndrome was considered \nlikely. The renal service was involved to monitor his \nrequirements for hemodialysis.\n.\n7. Metabolic acidosis:  Anion gap initially 27, likely related \nto alcoholic ketoacidosis, closed following TIPS procedure and \nresolution of transaminitis.  Electrolytes were monitored and \naggresively repleted.\n.\n8. FEN: The patient was initially given thiamine, folate, D5, \nMVI, and electrolytes were monitored and repleted.  After \nplacement of an NG-tube, tube feeds were started with free water \nboluses via NG tube for hypernatremia 250cc Q4H + 1L D5 today \n(free water deficit was ~7L).  Erythromycin IV was used to \nencourage forward gi motility.\n.\n9. Prophylaxis: The patient wore pneumoboots and was treated \nwith IV protonix during the time he was sedated\/intubated.\n.\nAs the hepatorenal syndrome worsened, the liver and renal \nservices felt that the patient's prognosis was extremely poor \nand thus recommended against hemodialysis given that the patient \nwas unlikely to recover. After several family discussions, the \nfamily decided to withdraw care. The patient expired on \n[**3408-11-4**].\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n(Pt is non-compliant)\nBuspirone\nDisulfuram\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\nnone\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nbleeding gastric varices\nalcoholism\nhepatorenal syndrome\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nexpired\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nn\/a\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nn\/a\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 571**] MD [**MD Number 572**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2991**] MD [**MD Number 2992**] [**3408-11-8**] @ 1325\nSigned electronically by: DR.

Since the diagnosis, the patient\nhas been on Prednisone as well as trials of Methotrexate and\nCytoxan which she did not tolerate due to increased pulmonary\nsymptoms.  Because of cough and shortness of breath, the\npatient was seen by a pulmonologist in [**2740-11-21**], who\nperformed bronchoscopy which revealed dynamic airway\ncollapse.  The issue of tracheal bronchial stenting was\nraised but BIPAP, CPAP ventilation was initiated at that\ntime.  The patient was seen by rheumatology clinic here at\n[**Hospital1 10**] in [**2740-12-21**], and\nagain in the beginning of January at which time her\nPrednisone was decreased to 30 mg from 40 mg once daily.\nThere was a discussion of CellCept, however, that was not\ninitiated.\n\nThe patient was admitted to [**Hospital 83**] Hospital in [**2741-1-21**], with respiratory decompensation treated with increased\nsteroids, BIPAP and nebulizers.  She was readmitted on\n[**2741-3-14**], with increased shortness of breath at rest,\nsubacute in nature and progressive.  She denied any chest\npain, syncope, diaphoresis, fever, chills or sputum\nproduction.  She reports not being able to cough up the\nsputum.\n\nAt the outside hospital, Solu-Medrol, Levofloxacin, Lovenox,\nPepcid, nebulizer treatment and BIPAP were started and the\npatient was transferred to [**Hospital1 391**].  In addition, the patient was noted to be in rapid\natrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 150s\nwhich was responsive to Diltiazem.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

Digoxin 0.25 mg alternating with 0.125 mg once daily.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked thirty pack years, quit\nabout six months ago.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, pulse 88, blood pressure\n127\/66, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 92 to 94% on\nCPAP mask set at 10\/5.  Generally, the patient appeared\nbloated with moon facies using accessory muscles of\nrespiration.  Skin was pink with dry mucous membranes.  Head,\neyes, ears, nose and throat examination - Extraocular\nmovements are intact.  Neck was obese, no obvious jugular\nvenous distention or lymphadenopathy was noted.  The heart\nhad distant sounds, regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no\nobvious murmurs.  The lungs had inspiratory wheezes\nbilaterally.  The lungs were without dullness or egophony.\nThe abdomen was obese, mildly distended with decreased bowel\nsounds, nontender.  Extremities showed slight edema, no\ncyanosis or clubbing.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  From outside hospital on [**2741-3-17**], white\nblood cells 13.8, hematocrit 38.0, platelet count 311,000.\nChem7 showed sodium 145, potassium 4.5, chloride 102,\nbicarbonate 30, blood urea nitrogen 25, creatinine 0.6,\nglucose 205. Digoxin level 1.1.\n\nChest x-ray from outside hospital by report showed left\nbasilar atelectasis, no congestive heart failure or\ninfiltrate.  CT of the neck performed in [**2741-1-21**], showed\ndiffuse tracheal bronchial wall thickening with associated\nair soft luminal narrowing with tracheal narrowing most\nsevere just above the level of the aortic arch and main stem\nbronchi, right upper lobe bronchus and bronchus intermedius.\nThere were also nonspecific patchy ground glass opacities\nwithin the upper lobes.\n\nElectrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus\ntachycardia at 100 beats per minute, normal axis and normal\nintervals, left atrial abnormality, right atrial abnormality.\nNo T wave changes or pathological Q waves.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 57 year old\nfemale with relapsing polychondritis, breast cancer, status\npost mastectomy, presenting with two months worsening\nshortness of breath due to tracheal chondromalacia and\ndynamic airway collapse.\n\nDuring this hospitalization, the patient's issues included:\n1.  Respiratory failure - Initially the patient was on BIPAP,\nhowever, in the setting of desaturation to the mid 80s, the\ndecision was made to intubate.  Following intubation, the\npatient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed diffuse airway\ncollapse especially at the trachea and the main stem bronchi.\n\nThe patient's respiratory failure could also have a component\nof chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given her thirty\npack year smoking history and a bicarbonate on admission of\n35.\n\nFor a possibility of infection contributing to the patient's\npulmonary problem, the patient was continued on Levofloxacin\nand Flagyl was added.  She was continued on her steroids as\nwell as Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.\n\nThe patient underwent second bronchoscopy on [**2741-3-19**], with\nbilateral main stem and tracheal stent placements.  Over the\nnext few days, her sedation was decreased and trials of\nextubation were initiated.  Her sputum culture grew gram\npositive cocci for which she was started on Vancomycin in\naddition to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.\n\nIn light of persistent airway collapse distant to the stents,\nat extensive family discussions, the patient's code status\nwas changed to \"Do Not Resuscitate\".  As sedation was weaned\ndown, the patient expressed wish to be extubated.  The\npatient wished not to be reintubated in case she would not be\nable to support herself.  The patient was extubated on\n[**2741-3-24**].  She was not able to support her ventilation or\noxygenation and was pronounced dead at 7:16 p.m. on [**2741-3-24**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\nCAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure due to dynamic airway\ncollapse from advanced polychondritis leading to\ntracheomalacia.\n\n2.  Infectious disease - The patient did spike fevers for\nwhich antibiotics were initiated.  Besides gram positive\ncocci in the sputum, all her cultures were negative.\n\n3.  Rheumatoid  disease - Polychondritis - The patient was\ncontinued on steroids with attempts to wean them.\nRheumatology consultation was also following the patient.\n\n4.  Cardiovascular - During this hospitalization, the patient\nhad runs of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular\nresponse rate for which she was continued on Diltiazem and\nDigoxin.\n\n5.  Endocrine - For her increased blood sugar on steroids,\nthe patient was maintained on NPH and regular sliding scale\ninsulin.  For her hypothyroidism, she was continued on\nLevoxyl.\n\n6.  Access - On [**2741-3-21**], right IJ was placed without\ncomplications.  In addition, for monitoring of blood pressure\nand respiratory status, left radial arterial line was placed.\n\n7.  Prophylaxis - During hospitalization, the patient was\ncontinued on Protonix and subcutaneous Heparin for\nprophylaxis.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Hypoxic and hypocarbic respiratory failure.\n2.  Polychondritis.\n3.  Tracheomalacia and dynamic airway collapse, status post\nairway stenting.\n4.  Breast cancer.\n5.  History of thyroid nodule.\n6.

She remained hemodynamically stable.  She was awake\nand alert.  Her arterial blood gases continued to improve.\n\nOn postoperative day one, her blood sugars remained high, and\nadjustments were made in her sliding-scale to bring her blood\nsugars to below 200.  As her diet was advanced, she was\nrestarted on her fixed NPH doses, and she is currently on her\nfull dose of 20 units in the morning and 15 units in the\nevening.  She was continued on perioperative antibiotics of\nceftazidime, Flagyl, and gentamicin which were discontinued\nafter 48 hours.\n\nOn postoperative day two, the patient was transferred to the\nfloor for the remainder of her recovery, where she has\nremained hemodynamically stable from a respiratory\nstandpoint.  Her wound has remained clean, dry, and intact.\nHer diet had been advanced to a regular low-fat\/diabetic diet\nwhich she was tolerating.  The patient has been ambulating\nwithout assistance, and has been voiding, and reports\npositive flatus.  The patient is now stable and ready for\ndischarge and was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in\napproximately one week.

Patient with \npronounced diarrhea, with cultures negative.  Hypernatremic and \nresolving renal failure.  Cultures to date negative.\n.\n.\n1)Infectious Process: \nOn admission to the MICU, patient thought to have sepsis and \nsevere hypovolemia in the setting of diarrhea.  Concern for \naspiration pneumonia or infectious diarrhea. Reccurent episodes \nof pneumonia and COPD exacerbation concerning for potential \naspiration.  \n-In MICU, required IV fluids and neosynephrine.  CVP 10-14.  \nReceived solumedrol in ED.  Initially, started broad spectrum \nvancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl.  Urine, blood, and stool \ncultures negative.  Patient came from nursing home where large \noutbreak of [**Location (un) **] virus.  \n-Speech and swallow performed video swallowing study, as concern \nfor aspiration pneumonia.  Patient will need to continue on \npureed solids and thick liquids to prevent aspiration.\n-Will be discharged on levofloxacin for four more days for COPD \nexacerbation.\n.  \n2)Respiratory Distress:  \nHypercarbic and hypoxemic repsiratory failure most likely \nsecondary to COPD flare. Previous ABGs revealed carbon dioxide \nretention. Cardiac ECHO on [**4-21**] revealed elevated right atrial \npressure and dilated right ventricle, consistent with pulmonary \nhypertension.  Placed on [**Hospital1 2999**] initially, but on discharge \ntolerating 2L nasal canula.  At baseline, patient requires \nsupplemental oxygen.  \n-Patient to continue on levofloxacin and prednisone, as \nrespiratory distress most consistent with COPD exacerbation.  \nWill continue prednisone for four more days.  40mg for the next \ntwo days and then 20mg for the following two days.  Patient will \nalso complete four more days of levofloxacin.\n-Patient will be discharged on lasix 40mg daily, PRN for \npulmonary congestion.\n.  \n3)Hypernatremia: \nOn admission, appeared hypovolemic, in setting of diarrhea.  \nPatient with dementia, so difficult to maintain adequate \nhydration.  Initially, calculated free water deficit of 3.9 \nliters.  Continued to gently hydrate with IV fluids and follow \nserum sodium levels.  By discharge, sodium corrected at 147.  \nContinue to encourage PO liquid supplementation.\n.  \n4)Diarrhea: \nPatient from nursing home where previous norovirus outbreak.  \nSent stool cultures for C. dificile and cultures.  Initially \nstarted metronidazole for empiric coverage.\n-Patient's diarrhea resolved on discharge.  Stool cultures \nnegative to date.\n.  \n5) Altered Mental Status:  \nUnderlying schizophrenia and dementia.  Improved mental status \nwith improved ventilation.  Head CT negative for intracranial \nhemorrhage.  Vitamin B12 864.  Depakote level 16.  Initially \nheld all psychotropic medications for schizophrenia, but \nrestarted on [**4-21**].  \n.  \n6) Acute renal insufficiency:\nOn presentation, creatinine 1.4, with baseline creatinin \n0.8-1.0.  With IV fluids, creatinine improved to 0.7.\n.  \n7) Anemia:  \nPatient with history of macrocytic anemia on B12 \nsupplementation. Iron studies on [**2931-3-27**] demonstrated ferritin \n127, TIBC 246, iron 53.  \n. \n8) Diabetes:\nPlaced on insulin sliding scale.  Switched to glargine 10 and \nhumalong sliding scale.\n-On discharge, will need to continue to monitor blood sugars, as \npatient receiving prednisone.\n. \n9) Prophylaxis:\nPlaced on PPI and heparin subcutaneously.

CTs there showed a deep right \nsided periventricular infarct as well as scattered infarcts in \nthe deep white matter bilaterally as well as in the pons. His \ninfarct was felt to be small vessel.  He had carotids <40% \nbilat, TTE with 55% EF, septal hypokinesis, LVH with DD, Mild \nAS, trace TR and MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was 203, LDL=140, HDL=36.  His zocor \nwas increased to 80 from 40 and ASA 325 was added(per notes he \nwas not on antiplt before).  Per notes, he had essential full \nstrength throughout and had an \"expressive aphasia\" and \ndysphagia, but did pass a swallow exam for thicked lqs.  \n\nHe was at rehab today and reportedly had acute onset of new left \nsided weakness, facial droop, and drooling.  This was a clear \nchange per the PT at rehab which he was walking with at the \ntime. The pt is mildly confused and reports that his current \npresentation is no different from how he has been at rehab.  \nThis is unlikely as he was reportedly walking there and his LE \nstrength would not currently allow this.  He continues to have \ndysarthria.\n\nHe was a code stroke and we responded within 3-4 minutes.  His \ninitial NIHSS was 8(2 for face, 1 for arm weakness, 3 for leg \nweakness, 1 for mild aphasia, 1 for dysarthria).  He had a CT \nwhich showed the previously described infarct and CTA showed no \nobvious blockage.  He was slightly improved in the ED here.  TPA \nwas not used as these deficits were very similar to his prior \ninfarct and it was not clear that this was a new event as \nopposed to re-expression or completion of his prior event. \n\nFS was initially 109, but on labs here it was 79.  It did drop \nas low as 53 in the ED here as well.  This was treated with 1\/4 \namp D50 and then went to 89, dropped back to 79 and he got \nanother 1\/4 amp D50.  He was on D51\/2NS for this time as well. \n\nROS: Patient denies any headache, dizziness, visual changes, \ndiplopia, but his MS and language make further discussion \ndifficult.\n \nPast Medical History:\nCAD s\/p ?valve replacement, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DMII, \ndepression, and AV pacemaker.

Atherosclerotic disease involving bilateral common carotid \nbifurcation, cavernous ICA and proximal ICA, with no flow \nlimiting stenosis.\n2. Large area of prolonged mean transit time in the right MCA \nterritory with normal blood volume, of uncertain etiology.\n3. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the cervical \nspine.\n4. Extensive emphysematous changes in the upper lobes of both \nlungs, including subpleural blebs.\n5. 4 mm nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung with the \nanother possible small nodule in the left upper lobe.\nFindings were discussed with the clinical team on [**3128-7-5**] by Dr. \n[**Last Name (STitle) 5492**] at approximately 4:30-5 p.m.\n\nCarotid Echo:  There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and a \n60-69% left ICA stenosis. There is significant disease in both \nthe right and the left external carotid arteries as well and \nthere is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.\n\nCT Head repeat:  FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage. \n There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline \nstructures.  Ventricular size is unchanged, and basal cisterns \nare unremarkable.  Chronic lacunar infarcts in the bilateral \ncapsular ganglionic regions are unchanged, as is focal areas of \nhypodensity within the cerebral peduncles and pons.  Note is \nagain made of vascular calcifications.  Surrounding osseous and \nsoft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process, no significant \nchange since \n[**3128-7-5**]. \n\nCT Chest: FINDINGS:  Multiple mediastinal lymph[**MD Number 112**] range up \nto 9.5 mm in prevascular, 7 mm in the right lower paratracheal \nand 1 cm in subcarinal locations. No evidence of significant \nhilar lymphadenopathy is present, although the evaluation is \ndifficult in the absence of intravenous contrast. Coronary \ncalcifications involve the native coronary arteries. The patient \nhas had aortic valve replacement and CABG . Heart size is normal \nand there is no pericardial effusion.\n\nThe airways are patent. Secretions in the trachea and right main \nbronchus are noted, 3:22, 23. Significant upper lobe \ncentrilobular emphysema is present. A, noncalcified, 5mm right \nupper lobe nodule, 3:20, is unchanged. Peribronchial opacities \nin the left lower lobe with some discrete areas of consolidation \nare unchanged compared to [**3128-7-5**] and may represent resolving \npneumonia or recurrent aspiration. Dependent atelectasis\nin the right lower lobe is minimal.\n\nAorta and pulmonary vessels are unremarkable within the \nlimitations of this unenhanced study.\n\nThe evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates bilateral \ndiffuse adrenal enlargement of low density up to 12 Hounsfield \nunits, most likely representing adrenal hyperplasia. Bilateral \nlow density renal lesions are noted, some of them too small to \nbe characterized by CT. Small left renal stone on the upper pole \nis less then 3 mm and ajacent area of medullary hyperdensity \nmight represent stone or medullary calcification. Gallstones \nnoted, with no evedence of cholecystitis.\n\nDegenerative changes within the thoracic spine are noted with no \nlesions suspicious for malignancy.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Right upper lobe non-calcified 5 mm nodule; followup in six \nmonths is recommended in the absence of known history of \nmalignancy.\n2. Centrilobular emphysema predominantly involving the upper \nlobes.\n3. Left lower lobe consolation due to aspiration or pneumonia.\n4. Subcentimeter mediastinal lymph node most likely reactive.\n5. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.\n6. Bilateral renal hyperdense lesions. Evaluation by ultrasound \nis recommended for precise characterization. Small left renal \nstones.\n7. Gallstones. No evidence of cholecystitis.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nNeurological:\nMr [**Known patient lastname 5493**] was admitted to the Stroke\/Neurology service.  He did \nnot receive TPA for reasons explained above: that he had \nintermittent hypoglycemia that was thought to be exacerbating \nprior stroke deficits.  The following days he was noted to have \nfluctuation in symptoms of the left sided weakness despite \nnormal glucose levels.  He was at times clearly antigravity in \nthe left arm and leg, and then was at other times noted to be \nsignificantly weaker and unable to perform any antigravity \nmotion on that side.  The weakness seemed exacerbated by his \nbeing out of bed to chair and it was thought that he was likely \npressure dependent.  He was thus made bed rest with HOB flat and \nhis pressures were allowed to autoregulate high with goal SBP \n180-200.  He was admitted to NSICU for permissive hypertensive \ntherapy.  However, his left sided weakness persisted & it was \nfelt that he has completed his stroke.  A repeat CT after \nadmission was unchanged.\n\nA carotid echo showed less than 40% stenosis left and 60-69% on \nthe right.  The side of greater stenosis is his asymtomatic \nside.\n\nHBA1c and Fasting lipid panel as above.\nHe was continued on Zocor 80, ASA 325, and antihypertensives \nwere initially held.\n\nCVS:\nRuled out for MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  On \nTelemetry was noted to have one run of V-tach for several \nseconds just minutes after having his bladder irrigated.  He was \nasymptomatic, hemodynamically stable and had a normal 12 lead \nEKG.\n\nResp: no respiratory issues\n\nGI: received protonix for GI prophylaxis.  No other GI issues.\n\nID: No ID issues as of 6\/1.\n\nEndo: HbA1c was 5.3.  Oral antihyperglycemics held on admission. \n Was given D5 in fluids at admission for his hypoglycemia.  \nSugars were within acceptable limits over the first night.  Was \ncovered additionally with a Regular Insulin Sliding Scale.\n\nRenal: no renal issues as of 6\/1.\n\nFEN: Patient initially had nasogastric tube placed and was \nfollowed by speech and swallow specialist.

Gets most of his care through the\nV.A. system.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  His temperature was 99.9\nwith a blood pressure of 166\/80, heart rate 98, respiratory\nrate 34.  Oxygen saturation was 90% on room air, 100% on\nnonrebreather.  General:  This is an elderly male appearing\nhis stated age in moderate distress.  Pupils equal, round and\nreactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucus\nmembranes moist.  No meningismus.  Patient noted to have\nbilateral crackles one-half the way up.  He had a regular\nrate and rhythm, S1, S2.  He had a [**3-16**] crescendo-decrescendo\nmurmur that was systolic.  Abdomen soft, non-tender,\nnon-distended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Patient noted to have\n1+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Extremities were warm and dry.\nNo rashes were apparent.\n\nLABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count 10, hematocrit 32,\nplatelet count 311,000.  Sodium 132, potassium 5.2, chloride\n92, bicarb 33, BUN 51, creatinine 1.4, glucose 347.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Given the patient's significant dyspnea on Emergency\nDepartment admission patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV,\nstarted on nitroglycerin drip and was given nonrebreather\nfollowed by CPAP but became agitated and sats remained\nsuboptimal.  The patient was emergently intubated in the\nEmergency Department for respiratory failure.  Chest film\nobtained in the Emergency Department was consistent with\ncongestive heart failure.  The patient was transferred to the\nCardiac Intensive Care Unit for management of presumed\ncongestive heart failure.  Patient was also begun on empiric\nantibiotics given high level of suspicion for pneumonia given\nthe patient's fever and productive cough.  The patient was\nbegun on levofloxacin as well as vancomycin given his history\nof methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Patient was\naggressively diuresed, however, remained febrile with\nincreasing secretions.  His initial sputum culture as well as\nblood culture grew out MRSA and patient was continued on\nvancomycin which was begun on the [**1-13**].  The patient\nwas transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the [**1-15**] for further management.  MICU course was notable for\nsignificant improvement in his respiratory status with\nongoing diuresis and antibiotics as well as frequent chest PT\nand frequent nebs.  The patient was successfully extubated on\nthe [**1-16**].  The patient initially required significant\noxygen via nasal cannula but was progressively weaned to\nminimal oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient defervesced\nwhile in the Intensive Care Unit and remained afebrile for\nseveral days prior to discharge from the Intensive Care Unit\non the [**1-21**].  Over that time his white blood cell\ncount also decreased significantly.  After discharge the\npatient was weaned off oxygen via nasal cannula to the point\nwhere he was requiring only one liter of oxygen via nasal\ncannula.  He was able to ambulate 40 feet prior to discharge\nwith a room air saturation in the 86-95% range while\nambulating.\n\n2.  Congestive heart failure.  As mentioned above the patient\nwas aggressively diuresed and initially received intravenous\nLasix and was switched to a p.o. regimen on the [**1-19**].  The patient's p.o. Lasix was increased from 80 mg\np.o. q. day to 80 b.i.d.  The patient was noted to have\nimproving congestive heart failure but was noted to still\nhave some failure on physical examination through the [**1-25**].  The patient underwent repeat echocardiogram on the\n[**1-12**] which demonstrated severe global left\nventricular hypokinesis as well as distal anterolateral and\nbasal inferoseptal walls that contract the best.  No discrete\nleft ventricular thrombus was seen.  Right ventricular cavity\nwas mildly dilated with inferior wall hypokinesis.  When\ncompared with a prior study of [**2717-11-10**] the patient's\nleft ventricular systolic function was more depressed and\npatient appeared to have a higher level of pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension.  His ejection fraction was estimated\nto be between 20 and 25%.\n\n3.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.\nPatient was noted to have MRSA bacteremia on admission.\nSubsequent blood cultures were negative after the initiation\nof vancomycin.  Patient was also noted to have MRSA urinary\ntract infection on admission as well as MRSA positive sputum\nculture as mentioned above.  Given the concern for\nendocarditis as a possible source of his MRSA bacteremia,\npatient underwent initially transthoracic echocardiogram and\nlater transesophageal echocardiography on the [**11-26**].\nThe transesophageal echocardiogram d[**MD Number 525**] demonstrate any\nevidence of vegetation in his cardiac valves.  As mentioned\nbefore, the patient defervesced while in the Intensive Care\nUnit and remained afebrile for several days prior to\ndischarge and had a white count that decreased from 10 on\nadmission to 8.3 on the day prior to discharge.\n\n4.  Acute cholecystic hepatitis.  Patient was noted to have\nan elevated alkaline phosphatase while in the Intensive Care\nUnit that had elevated from his admission level of 760 to a\nmaximum of 1375 on the [**11-21**].  This was accompanied\nby increase in his total bilirubin from admission value of\n1.4 up to 2.2 also on the [**11-21**] and a mild\ntransaminitis which peaked at 41 with ALT on the 11th and 41\nas well for the AST on the 11th.  The patient, however, had a\nbenign abdominal examination and a right upper quadrant\nultrasound showed no evidence of ductal dilatation and normal\nflow.  Specifically, the common bile duct measured 4-5 mm and\nthe portal vein was open with hepatopetal flow.  Given the\npatient's TPN he was not a candidate for MRCP and a decision\nwas made not to pursue ERCP in this patient given his benign\nabdominal examination given the significant risks given the\npatient's cardiac status as he was anticoagulated for his\natrial fibrillation and also because his alkaline phosphatase\nbegan to decrease from its peak on the [**11-21**] and\nshortly decreased to 1000 the day prior to discharge.\nLikewise, his bilirubin decreased from the peak level of 2.2\ndown to 1.3 on the day prior to discharge.  The patient will\nfollow up with his gastroenterologist following discharge.\n\n5.  Anemia.  The patient was noted to have a baseline iron\ndeficient anemia.  His hematocrit on admission was 26.\nPatient received two units of packed red blood cells and his\nhematocrit remained stable throughout the remainder of the\nhospitalization.  He was noted to have guaiac positive stool\nand the patient will follow up once again with his\ngastroenterologist following discharge as he will require a\nfollow-up colonoscopy.\n\n6.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient remained well rate\ncontrolled on his regimen of metoprolol and he was maintained\non Coumadin for his target INR of 2.0 to 3.0.\n\n7.  Hypertension:  The patient was noted to have labile blood\npressures throughout the course of his admission.  He briefly\nrequired a nitroglycerin drip while in the Intensive Care\nUnit which was successfully discontinued.  His captopril dose\nwas titrated to 100 mg t.i.d. and his Toprol was increased to\n37.5 mg t.i.d.  The patient was also given p.r.n.\nhydralazine.  His blood pressures remained stable on an oral\nregimen following his transfer to the Medical floor on the\n[**11-22**].\n\n8.  Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was maintained on his\noutpatient regimen of NPH 35 q. a.m., 15 q. p.m. as well as\nregular insulin sliding scale.\n\n9.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient was maintained on\naspirin, statin, beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as above.\n\n10. Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine\nremained stable throughout the course of the hospitalization.\nHis creatinine was 1.7 on admission and 1.6 the day prior to\ndischarge.\n\n11. Physical therapy:  The patient was initially able to only\nwalk several steps without significant difficulty.  However,\nwith physical therapy he was able to increase his endurance\nto the point that he could walk 40 feet the day prior to\ndischarge.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Include:\n1.  Respiratory distress.\n2.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.\n3.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.\n4.

Chemistries revealed a sodium of 141, potassium 4.3,\nchloride 105, C02 26, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9 with a glucose\nof 115, calcium 9.3, magnesium 1.9, phosphate 3.3.\n\nPulmonary function testing done on [**2592-7-13**] with\nmoderate to restrictive impairment with decreased FVC and\nFEV1 and normal FEV1\/FVC.\n\nTransthoracic echocardiogram done on [**2592-9-14**]\nshowed left atrium mildly dilated with an abnormal shadowing\nechodensity in the posterior portion consistent with a clot,\nmoderate to severely reduced global left ventricular systolic\nfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25% consistent with\nhis history of MI, coronary artery disease, status post CABG.\n\nChest CT done on [**2592-9-12**] showed a small subdural hemorrhage\nalong the right tentorium, cerebellum, without mass affect,\nsmall right frontal and parietal infarcted areas were noted.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient\nwas afebrile with a temperature of 96.7, heart rate 78, blood\npressure 120\/64, respiratory rate 20, saturating at 96% on\nroom air.  General:  The patient was alert and oriented times\nthree, in no apparent distress.  The patient stridorous but\nspeaking.  HEENT:  Pupils were equally round and reactive to\nlight and accommodation with extraocular movements intact.\nThe oropharynx was clear without any lesions.  Neck:  Supple,\nnontender, no bruits noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally with transmitted upper airway noise.\nCardiovascular:  Irregularly\/irregular heart rate, no audible\nmurmurs.  Abdomen:  Bowel sounds soft, nontender,\nnondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.\nExtremities:  No edema with good palpable dorsalis pedis\npulses.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly\nintact with intact motor and sensory systems in the\nextremities grossly.  The rectal examination was Guaiac\nnegative.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a flexible\nbronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology and was found to\nhave severe obstruction at the proximal trachea and was\nadmitted for further observation and management.  Because of\nhis subtherapeutic anticoagulation, the patient was started\non a heparin drip with a goal to titrate up to PTT of 60-80.\n\nNeurology consult was obtained.  A review of the head CT was\ndone.  There were no absolute contraindications to\nanticoagulation from their point of view.  Cardiology consult\nwas also called for preoperative evaluation and it was felt\nthat there was no evidence of ongoing ischemia or severe\ndecompensation of heart failure at this time.  The patient\nstill has moderate to high risk of perioperative cardiac\nevent.  The patient was started on a beta blocker\npreoperatively.\n\nBecause of the severe tracheal stenosis and danger of airway\nobstruction, the patient was admitted to the MICU for\nobservation prior to surgery.  The patient was evaluated by\nthe Thoracic Surgery Service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 682**] as consulted by\nInterventional Pulmonology and for possible surgical\nintervention.  At the time, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12383**] and his family said\nthat they did not want a tracheostomy nor did they want a T\ntube and stated that he would prefer to die than to have\nthose procedures.  Therefore, the patient was recommended a\ntracheal resection and reconstruction or a bronchoscopic\nprocedure.\n\nAfter the risks of the surgery was fully explained and all\nquestions were answered and informed consent was obtained,\nthe patient was taken to the OR on [**2592-10-8**] for a\npossible tracheal resection and reconstruction.  However,\nthis procedure was aborted due to the inability to establish\nwith any degree of certainty that the anastomosis would be\ndue without any undue tension.  The patient went ahead with\nthe alternative plan for a bronchoscopic approach and\nunderwent a rigid bronchoscopy with dilatation and stent of\nthe proximal tracheal stenosis on [**2592-10-8**] by\nInterventional Pulmonology.\n\nPostoperatively, the patient did relatively well.  On\npostoperative day number one, the patient was complaining of\ndifficulty swallowing.  Given his prior history of CVA and\ndysphagia, Speech and Swallow consult was called.  The\ninitial evaluation was that the patient did not demonstrate\nany overt signs or symptoms of aspiration.  The patient went\nahead with a video swallow study.  On video swallow study,\nthe patient demonstrated aspiration with nectar-thick liquids\nand thin liquids and the patient was initially placed on\nn.p.o. status.\n\nHowever, after an extensive discussion with the\nInterventional Pulmonology Team and with the patient, it was\nclear that this was not an acute process given his history of\nCVA and his history of dysphagia and given the fact that the\npatient was only a few days out from surgery that these\nfindings may be transiently related to postoperative\nrecovery.\n\nWith the patient's insistence on starting on a pureed diet\nwhich he had been taking prior to admission and with full\nunderstanding of risks of aspiration and pneumonia as\nexplained by the staff to the patient, the patient was\ncautiously started on a pureed diet.  The patient tolerated a\npureed diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.  The\npatient was also started on Coumadin per his schedule and\ncontinued on IV heparin and because his INR was not\ntherapeutic the patient was converted over to Lovenox\nanticoagulation therapy at 70 mg subcutaneously q. 12 hours\nfor full anticoagulant effect while he continued his\nanticoagulation with p.o. Coumadin at rehabilitation.  At\ndischarge, the patient's INR was 1.9.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to rehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.

Respiratory failure -- Initially intubated at an OSH, Mrs. \n[**Known patient lastname 6329**] proved difficult to extubate because of poor oxygenation \nrelated to large bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.  Given \nher low EF, this was first felt to be related to pulmonary \nedema, however, when these continue to worsen despite adequate \ndiuresis, an infectious source became the prime suspect.  \nBecause of her history of cough\/myalgias, she underwent nasal \nwashings for the flu and was put on droplet precautions; the DFA \ncame back positive, and per ID's reccomendations, oseltamivir \nwas begun.  Given her functionally neutropenic state, cefepime \nand vancomycin also were initiated for a possible bacterial \nprocess, with azithromycin added later for atypicals.  She \nspiked a temperature to 104 the first night, but all cultures \nfailed to grow.  Although afebrile following this, her \ntemperature curve could not be interpreted due to steroids given \nin stress-dosing.\nOn this antimicrobial regimen along with diuresis, her sats \nintially improved, and she was able to be extubated.  However, \nthe following day her steroids were stopped and she became \nincreasingly tachypneic and re-spiked a temperature.  Her chest \nx-ray showed progression of the infiltrate and she wae \nre-intubated, primarily for bronchoscopy.  She was unable to be \nweaned off the ventilator, and eventually developed pulmonary \nchanges consistent with end-stage ARDS\/fibrosis.  She was \nstarted on steroids, and remained intubated.  After 2 weeks on \nsteroids repeat CXR should slight improvement of diffuse \ninfiltrates.  Her ventilatory settings were gradually weaned and \nshe was able to tolerate PS with minimal pressures and PEEP.  \nShe was tolerating PS for 24 hour periods at a time.   \nUnfortunatley she had an event of hemoptysis in which she \ndesaturated into the 70's and required increase vent support.  \nTwo felx bronchs were done which could not identify a focal \nsource for the bleeding.  She only lost a small amount of blood \nand ultimately it was felt to be caused by aggressive \nsuctioning.  After this event she had no further hemoptysis \nhowever she required AC on the vent.  Attempts were made to try \nPS but the patient only lasted 15 minutes or so before tired.  \nAlso around this time she developed fevers and bacteremia.  It \nwas then decided to hold off any attempts at weaning and keep \nthe patient on full vent support until she cleared the \ninfections and was afebrile.  CXR during this period showed \npersistent signs of ARDS with no improvement in lungs on CXR. \n\nThe patient had increasing respiratory distress from [**2697-3-20**] \nonward and became increasingly difficult to ventilate with \nworseining CXR on full coverage of antimicrobial agents. In \naddition, she required three pressors support over the period \nfrom [**Date range (1) 6330**]. The decision was made by the family to withdraw \npressors on [**2-25**]. She died within hours. \n\n2. Blast crisis -- Most likely AML.  She was intially \nleukopheresed, bringing her WBC down from 60,000 to 30,000 and \nwas started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol.  DIC and tumor lysis \nlabs were followed every six hours but remained negative.  More \ndefinitive chemotherapy was initially put on hold given her poor \nrespiratory function\/infection (as described below) and her \ninitial echo with and EF of 30%.  Her counts continued to drop \nwhile on hydrea, until eventually it was discontinued.  She was \ntransfused multiple times to keep her Plt > 10 and Hct > 20, \neventually having a minimal response to transfusions.  DAT was \npositive for anti-SDH, which according to the blood bank, was \nnot enough to account for what would have been the degree of \nhemolysis needed for the lack of response. Oncology determined \nthat the patient was too ill to begin chemotherapy; her WBC \neventually decreased to consistently below 1000 total.  She \nremained neutropenic for 2-3 weeks then as she improved her WBC \nbegan to slowly rise again.  She had a period where she was \nnon-neutropenic for about 7 days during whichc she was afebrile \nand off of antibiotics.  Also noted during this period was that \nshe had no blasts in her peripheral blood samples.  Thus it was \ndecided to re check a bone marrow biopsy to determine if the \npatient had AML or more of a MDS picture.  Bone marrow biopsy \ndemonstrated 20% blasts indicative of AML.  After being \nnon-neutropenic for 7 days or so her counts began to drop at \nwhich point it was discovered she had VRE and MRSA bactermia.  \nAlso she now had blasts back in her peripheral blood.  At this \npoint from heme\/onc position the patient would require induction \nchemotherapy to induce remission and then the only curative \nmeasure would be BMT.  However given the patients condition this \nwas not an option as she would not survive chemotherapy given \nher state of health.  Discussion was held with the family and \ngoal was for patient to go to rehab with possibilities of \nregaining her strength their and maybe at some point down the \nline she may be strong enough to go through chemo.  \n\n3. Anisochoria -- Noted on the first morning of admission, the \npatient's anisochoria manifested as a dilated right pupil that \nwas sluggishly reactive as compared to a smaller, reactive left \npupil.  This finding was [**Location (un) **] out in both bright and dim light \nand was clearly different from her admission physical exam.  A \nstat head CT was obtained without obvious abnormalities and \nneurology was consulted.  An MRI additionally failed to provide \nand explanation, and ultimately, it was felt that this was due \nto the disease process, possibly a leukemic infiltrate. She was \ngiven intrathecal methotrexate empirically, followed by \nintrathecal cytarabine.  On CT she was also noted to have \nsplenic infarcts; however, her other respiratory and infectious \nproblems prevented any further workup for possible infiltrative \ndisease.    \n\n4. Elevated LFTs -- Present upon admission, the top two theories \nwere alcholic hepatitis versus leukemic infiltration.  She had \nan ultrasound that showed findings consistent with fatty liver \ndisease and a solitary nodule.  Hepatitis panels were negative.  \nHer LFT's remained stable but elevated, and CT showed liver \ndisease, which would have required MRI or biopsy; however, other \nclinical problems prevented further workup.  Her LFT's remained \nslightly eleavted with high ALT, TBili, Alk phos.  These were \nmonitored and remained unchanged.  RUQ uUS showed no evidence of \ncholecystitis but she did have a thickened GB fundus indicative \nof possible adenomyomatosis.  This will need to be followed up \nafter d\/c from the hospital.  Otherwise she had no specific abd \ncomplaints and her labs were followed.\n\n5. ID: The patient had a positive DFA, and was started on \ntamiflu empirically.  She was also then started on amantadine \nempirically.  She underwent several BALs during the admission, \nwhich were all negative for everything except influenza A--the \nfinal one was negative for the flu.  She was started on broad \nspectrum antibiotics for frequent fevers.  She was also started \non ambisome, which was discontinued due to renal failure; then \ncaspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole due to concerns \nfor cholestasis.  Blood cultures from her RSC line grew VRE, for \nwhich she was treated with 14 days of daptomycin.  She was \ncontinued on imipenem and voriconazole empirically for febrile \nneutropenia.  Galactomannan and histoplasma antigen were both \nnegative.  Pt was then on imipenem and voriconazole for several \nweeks while she was neutropenic.  Her counts gradually came up \nand she remained afebrile.  After she was non-neutropenic for \nseveral days and afebrile the imipenem and voriconazole were \nremoved.  She was off antibiotics for at least seven days.  Then \nher counts dropped again and she developed fevers.  Bld cultures \ninitially grew out VRE.  So she was restarted on daptomycin, and \n cefepime was added as well for fever of neutropenia.   Her \ncentral line was removed and changed to PICC line however she \nthen developed MRSA in her bld cultures.  This was a high grade \nbacteremia with multiple cultures coming back positive.  She was \ncontinued on the daptomycin which will cover both VRE and MRSA.  \nAll central lines were removed and she was converted to PIV's, \ngiving her a central access holiday.  She continued to spike and \nwas found to have sparce growth of aspergillus in her sputum.  \nGalactomannan was sent and was pending.  However given this \nfinding and persistent fevers of neutropenia voriconazole was \nadded back to abx regimen.  \n\n6. Hypotension: The patient was on and off pressors throughout \nthe hospitalization.  Echo initially showed decreased EF, which \ngradually became hyperdynamic as she continued to be septic.  \nShe was on levo, then vasopressin, and is currently off \npressors.  She did not require any further pressors.  Even with \nher bacteremia her BP remained in the 100's.  She was given \nfluid boluses as needed and PRBCs.  Her volume status corrected \non its own as the patient autodiuresed which helped to \nsubstantially decrease her peripheral edema. \n\n7. Right dilated pupil- First noted around the time of \nadmission.  There was concern for CVA so MRI was done which was \nnegative for stroke.  At that point it was felt the dilated may \nhave been secondary to infiltration due to AML.  However given \nher other medical conditions this was not further worked up \nuntil later in her course.   As she improved form a resp \nstandpoint, her right eye was re-addressed.  Along with mental \nstatus changes there was concern for stroke.  Once again MRI of \nhead was done.  This time there was evidence of ischemia in 2 \nareas of the brain.   One was a watershed area which may have \noccurred when the patient was hypotensive.  The other was a \nsmall stroke that was concerning for embolic event.  However \nneither stroke could account for her MS changes or the dilated \nright pupil.  Ophtho was consulted and it was discovered that \nthe patient had acute angle glaucoma in the right eye which \ncould account for the dilation.  She was started on drops and \nher IOP slowly decreased.  It was felt she likely had acute \nglaucoma around time of admission leading to the dilatation of \nthe right eye. \n\n8. Neuro- As we were weaning the patint off the sedatives she \nwas very slow to respond and given the dilated right pupil there \nwas concerns about stroke and malignanat involvement of the CNS. \n As described above she had MRI which showed evidence of two \nareas of ischemia in the brain.  However they were small and \ncould not account for her MS changes.  Lumbar puncture was done \nto rule out malignant involvement.  This came  back negative for \nmalignant cells in the CSF.  Her stroke risk was also worked up \nwith negative vascular disease, carotid stenosis, and negaitve \necho.  Her MS slowly improved with time and was felt to have \nbeen caused by slow metabolism of the on board sedatives.  She \ngradually woke up and retured to relatively baseline MS.  \nUnfortunately she had developed severe muscle weakness during \nher stay likely secondary to steroids and critical illness.  EMG \nand nerve conduction studies showed severe ICU myopathy and \npolyneuropathy.  Her strength very slowly improved and PT saw \nthe patient and gave the family exercises to work on with the \npatient.\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\ndeath from respiratory failure\n \nDischarge Condition:\ndied\n \n                             [**Doctor First Name 368**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 372**] MD [**MD Number 1814**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 573**] MD [**Last Name (un) 574**] [**2697-2-24**] @ 1543\nSigned electronically by: DR.

She\nlives with her husband; quit seven years ago.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission vital\nsigns were temperature of 101.3, blood pressure of 129\/97,\nheart rate in the 90s, respiratory rate in the 20s, satting\n99% on 100%, FIO2 of 0.6, ventilator settings of synchronized\nintermittent mandatory ventilation 25 X 400.  She was awake,\nalert, cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat was\nunremarkable.  Lungs had coarse rhonchi, with some striatus\nupper airway sounds.  Heart was regular, tachycardic, with no\nmurmur appreciated.  The abdomen was benign, guaiac-negative.\nNo edema on extremities.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION: Laboratories\nshowed a white blood cell count of 10.9, hematocrit of 36.5,\nplatelets of 601.  Sodium of 137, potassium of 2.5,\nbicarbonate of 29, chloride of 95, blood urea nitrogen of 22,\ncreatinine of 0.9, and glucose of 144.  First creatine kinase\nwas 20.  Arterial blood gas on presentation was 7.42, with a\nPO2 of 180, and a PCO2 of 48.  After respiratory\ndecompensation on a setting of synchronized intermittent\nmandatory ventilation of 25 X 400 with 0.6, arterial blood\ngas was 7.29, a PO2 of 219, PCO2 of 65.\n\nRADIOLOGY\/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed patchy infiltrates in\nthe left lung zone, with a question of failure.\n\nElectrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 130, with a\nright bundle-branch block.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was heparinized for likely\npulmonary embolus versus pneumonia.  The patient was covered\nwith levofloxacin and Flagyl.\n\nA CT angiogram was considered; however, at this point, would\nnot change management.  The patient was continued on\nintermittent mandatory ventilation, still spiking\ntemperatures.  The patient ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction.  A CT angiogram was pursued, though with her\nfevers, this was likely a community-acquired pneumonia.  CT\nangiogram was negative for pulmonary embolus.  Heparin was\ndiscontinued; however, she continued to have increasing\nrespiratory distress with the white count slowly increasing\nup to 15,000.  Levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued,\nhowever, and the decision was made to continue with full\nsupport to see if the patient would turn around from her\nincreasing respiratory distress.  Blood urea nitrogen and\ncreatinine started to increase.  An arterial line was placed\nfor further blood pressure and ventilation management.\n\nRespiratory distress progressively worsened with an oxygen\nsaturation of 89%, an FIO2 of 60.  White count continued to\nincrease to 26.3, with a chest x-ray suggestive of a heavily\nconsolidated multilobar pneumonia on the left.  The patient\nbegan to become increasingly agitated, her breathing\nprogressively worsening, and renal failure did also\nprogressively worsen.\n\nAfter numerous discussions with the family, and taking into\nconsiderations the patient's wishes, the patient was made do\nnot resuscitate and ultimately comfort measures only.\nMorphine was initiated.  The ventilator was discontinued\nafter the patient was comfortable, and the patient expired at\n7:01 p.m. on [**3148-11-5**].

He \nhas not had a BM in three to four days and is passing no flatus \ncurrently. \n\nIn the ED, the patient was tachycardic to the 120's and was \nfebrile to 101, lactate 1.3. He was given 2L NS and a dose of \nlevo\/flagyl for possible aspiration. Hct stable at 34. He was \nevaluated for SBO by the general surgery team, who felt that \nbased on imaging and physical exam that this was gastric \ndistention, no surgery recommended at this time and advised iv \nppi and NGT for decompression.

Other contributing factors included hypernatremia \n(resolved), ICU psychosis, and untreated pain from bone \nmetastases.  Known brain metastases likely another contributing \nfactor.  Despite treatment of all possible reversible \netiologies, continued to have decreased mental status.  Given \npoor prognosis and failure to resume noteworthy function, \npatient was made DNR\/DNI and later CMO.  He expired [**2541-12-20**] due \nto cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n# Non-small cell lung cancer:  At initial diagnosis was stage IV \nwith metastatic lesions to his brain and bones.  Oncology \nconsulted initially on admission and later met with family [**12-18**] \nand informed them that he is not a candidate for chemotherapy \nbecause of his medical illness and poor performance status.  \nRad\/onc was also consulted concerning possible palliative \ntreatment but determined that he was too unstable for further \nintervention.  Ultimately Palliative Care was consulted and \nassisted in the transition to CMO status.\n\n# Respiratory Distress\/Pneumonia: While inpatient he had \nepisodes of respiratory distress that probably resulted from \nseveral factors, including his underlying pneumonia, difficulty \nclearing secretions, pain, and anxiety.  Leukocytosis and \ninfiltrates persisted despite treatment with Flagyl and \nceftriaxone.  Later Zosyn and vancomycin were started to cover \npossible nosocomial pathogens.  Respiratory distress continued \nto be progressive despite antibiotics and suctioning.  Once CMO \nstatus, his pain and distress with treated with morphine as \nneeded until he expired.\n\n# Demand Ischemia\/Tachycardia: Upon admission was found to be \nactively having a NSTEMI from d[**MD Number 4453**] ischemia in setting of \ntachycardia.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical \nmanagement given his tenuous status.  Troponins were followed \nuntil they peaked.  Tachycardia remained and appeared to be \nmultifactorial including pain and agitation.  He was treated \nwith gentle IV fluids, morphine for pain and Lopressor as \ntolerated until he expired.\n\n# Hematuria: Noted while inpatient and thought to be due to \ntrauma associated with Foley placement\/patient tugging on Foley. \n Urology was consulted and replaced his Foley.  He was also \ntreated with continuous bladder irrigation intermittently.  Once \nCMO status was determined, bladder irrigation was discontinued \nfor patient comfort.\n\n# Renal Failure:  Cr slowly increased during his \nhospitalization, likely associated with pre-renal etiology. His \nlisinopril was held for this reason.  He was treated with IVF \nand his Cr was monitored until he was made CMO status, at which \npoint further labs were not drawn.\n\n# Pain control:  Patient with significant pain, likely secondary \nto known bone metastates.  While inpatient, was started on a \nfentanyl patch and given IV morphine as needed for breakthrough \npain.   He was continued on morphine and fentanyl for comfort \nuntil he expired.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nLopressor 25mg BID  \nASA 81mg  \nSimvastatin 40mg  \nCilostazol 200mg qdaily  \nSLNTG  \nMorphine\/oxycontin (recently prescribed)  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary: Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic\n \nDischarge Condition:\nExpired.\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nExpired.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nExpired.\n \n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1293**] MD, [**MD Number 1294**]\n \nCompleted by: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 50**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 314**] MD [**MD Number 315**] [**2541-12-21**] @ 0401\nSigned electronically by: DR.

Recent PMHx begins in late [**7-3**] when \nhe was admitted here with gallstone pancreatitis. ERCP was \nattempted but they could not cannulate the CBD; symptoms \nimproved with supportive care and the pt was d\/c home after one \nweek. Sx recurred in mid-[**8-3**] when he was admitted to an OSH.  \nThere he was felt to need a ccy and so was sent here, where an \nERCP was repeated and the CBD cannulated with sphincterotomy and \nstone extraction; duodenal ulcers were also incidentally noted \nduring this study. A CT scan showed ? non-enhancing lesion at \nthe head of the pancreas (necrotizing pancreatitis vs. \npseudocyst). His hospital course was c\/b MRSA bacteremia found \non routine blood cxs [**8-6**]. A subsequent TEE was equivocal (debris \nwith calcifications vs. vegetations), so the plan was made for \nempiric treatment of endocarditis with vanco x6 weeks through a \nLUE PICC. The pt was ultimately discharged from the [**Hospital1 13**] on \n[**8-14**] to a NH. There he was getting vanco BID for 7-8 days, also \nprn Lasix for LE edema. He was sent in to an OSH [**8-22**] with a Cr \nof 4.4 (baseline 1.4), Hct 25 (baseline 30). His anemia was \nthought to likely be multifactorial (PUD vs. LGIB vs. renal \nfailure). He was initially given two unit pRBCs with an \nappropriate response. His FeNa there was c\/w pre-renal azotemia \nin the setting of total body volume overload. His meds renally \ndosed and his diuretics were held due to presumed intravascular \nvolume depletion. Despite low-salt albumin and the pRBC \ntransfusions noted above, his creatinine had increased to 6.0 on \nthe day prior to transfer here. He has also been oliguric \n(200-400 cc\/day for 5-6 days prior to transfer), and he has \ndeveloped hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema.  Discussions were \nheld with the patient and his family regarding the initiation of \nhemodialysis, and ultimately the decision was made to pursue a \ntrial of hemodialysis. He is therefore transferred here for \ninitiation of hemodialysis. \n\nOf note, the patient has reportedly also had progressive \nabdominal distension  over the [**Last Name (un) 6088**] 1-2 weeks. A KUB done at the \nOSH on the day prior to transfer was suggestive of a partial \nSBO. At no point, however, has he had n\/v or abd pain. He is \nhaving bowel movement and passing flatus, and he is tolerating a \npo diet. His lipase and amylase were also increasing, thus \nraising the question of recurrent pancreatitis.

Pt was total-body volume overload. This gradually \nimproved with hemo dilysis. As the admission progressed, renal \nfelt etiology more likely to be cholesterol emboli. Renal US was \ndone which ruled out obstructive etiology. Renal consult was \nobtained on admission and hemo dialysis was initiated. Pt was \nstabalized on a Mon-Wed-Fri regimen. Decision was made not to \npersue a renal biopsy as pt and family did not want any invasive \nprocedures. Hemodialysis became increasingly challenging \nsecondary to hypotension. On [**2789-9-9**], family decided not to \ncontinue with dialysis.\n\n2. Pancreatitis\/Pseudocyst: Enzymes mildly elevated on admission \n([**Doctor First Name **] 197, lipase 116). Noncontrast CT of abdomen was obtained \nwhich was concerning for a pancreatic pseudocyst. Surgery was \ninitially consulted but did not feel surgical intervention was \nwarrented. Pt was initially kept NPO with a NG tube and TPN for \nnutrition. However, he self discontined the NG tube on \n[**2791-8-1**]. On [**2791-8-4**], the pt developed increased abdominal \npain on exam. Abdominal film was unremarkable. After extensive \ndiscussion with the pt and family, they decided not to persue \nfurther imaging including CT scan or MRCP. They declined any \ninvasive intervention no matter the cause of abdominal pain. At \nthat time, the TPN was discontinued. Pt was allowed to eat as \ndesired with a pureed diet. However, he took little by mouth. Pt \nwas covered throughout the admission with meropenem and was \ndiscontinued on the day of discharge.\n\n5. Pneumonia: Unclear diagnosis at OSH, although there was a \nquestion of bibasilar infiltrates on admission CXR. He was \ntreated with ceftriaxone and flagyl.  He is currently \ncomfortable on room air with prn nebulizer treatments for \naudible wheezing. \n\n5. Anemia: Lab panel at OSH c\/w anemia of chronic disease. Hct \nstable here. \n\n7. MRSA Bacteremia: Patient was treated with vancomycin dosed by \nlevel and was maintained on contact precautions. Vancomycin was \ndiscontinued when pt was made CMO as levels were no longer \nobtained.\n\n8. VRE: Likely simply colonization of urinary tract. \n\n9. Access: LUE PICC, dialysis catheter\n\n10. F\/E\/N: POs as tolerated.\n\n11. Communication: With wife and daughter.\n\n12. Code: DNR\/DNI. CMO status established on [**2791-9-10**] after \nextensive discussions with wife and daughter.\n\n13.

Immediately, postoperatively, the patient\nbecame hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s\nand bradycardic with a pulse in the 40s with lateral\nelectrocardiogram changes.  As such, the patient was transferred\nto the Medical Service for further management.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

He denies tobacco or ethanol use.  He lives\nwith his stepdaughter.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a father with cancer, unknown\ntype.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vitals on transfer were\nas follows:  Temperature 96.7.  Pulse of 60.  Blood pressure\n143\/45.  Oxygen saturation of 96% on three liters.  He is a\npleasant elderly appearing man in no acute distress.   His\nmucous membranes were dry.  Oropharynx was clear without\nerythema.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.\nExtraocular movements intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.  His\nneck was supple, no lymphadenopathy.  His lungs were clear\nanteriorly.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3\/6\nsystolic murmur.  His abdomen was soft, nontender with\nnotable abdominal hernia.  His extremities had trace edema.\nHis epidural level was noted to be approximately T12.\n\nPERTINENT ADMISSION STUDIES:  White blood cell count 15.5,\nhematocrit 32.1, platelets 148,000, PT 13.1, INR 1.2, PTT\n26.3.  Sodium 136, potassium 5.2, chloride 103, bicarbonate\n25, BUN 47, creatinine 1.6 with a baseline creatinine of\napproximately 1.3.  Glucose 178, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.5,\nmagnesium 1.5.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm\nat a rate of 54 and axis of 100, intervals of 164, 110, [**Street Address 10705**] depressions in II, III and aVF and new ST depressions\nin V4 through V6 when compared to previous tracing of [**2598-4-9**].\n\nSUMMARY OF CURRENT HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred\nto the Medical Service for further management. Summary of his\nhospital course by systems is as follows:\n\n1.  Cardiac:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical\nService after he was noted to have electrocardiogram changes in\nthe setting of hypotension and bradycardia.  His cardiac enzymes\nwere cycled with a peak CK of 1971, but an MB of only 31 and an\nindex of 1.6.  His troponin was noted to be 13.5.  Another\ntroponin of 31.8 is believed to be erroneous. His\nelectrocardiogram changes resolved with normalization of his\nblood pressure.  The majority of his CK leak was believed\nsecondary to his surgery.  On [**2598-4-16**], the patient was\ntransferred to the Coronary Care Unit secondary to difficulty\nin controlling hypertension and started on intravenous nitrates\nat that time.  He was again noted to have lateral\nelectrocardiogram depressions, now in the setting of hypertension\nand heartburn.  The decision was made to take the patient to\ncardiac catheterization after esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Results\nof esophagogastroduodenoscopy will be subsequently noted.  The\ncatheterization showed native two vessel disease with patent\nleft internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and\nsaphenous vein graft to D1 grafts.  His ejection fraction was\nnoted to be 48% on left ventriculogram.  No significant lesions\nwere noted.  Decision was made to medically manage his\nhypertension and as such his beta-blocker was increased and an\nACE inhibitor was initiated.  His diuretic was restarted as well\nwith good response.\n\n2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had an acute elevation in\nhis white blood cell count to 23.1 with a possible left lower\nlobe infiltrate on chest x-ray on the day after his laminectomy.\nHe was pancultured and given his recent decreased level of\nconsciousness, and recent surgery, the decision was made to give\nbroad spectrum antibiotics.  Coverage with vancomycin,\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl to cover a possible aspiration pneumonia\nor infection at the site of surgery.  As it became clear that he\ndid not have a wound infection and the blood cultures returned\nwithout growth, the vancomycin was discontinued.  A ten day\ncourse of antibiotics was then completed for probable aspiration\npneumonia.\n\n3.  Renal:  The patient has known chronic renal insufficiency\nbelieved secondary to his diabetes and hypertension; baseline\ncreatinine is approximately 1.3.  Through the episode of\npostoperative hypotension described above, the patient went into\nATN with muddy brown casts on his urine.  Peak creatinine was\n1.9. This resolved with hydration and the holding of nephrotoxic\ndrugs including diuretics.  He also had a mild elevation in\ncreatinine after receiving the dye load of cardiac\ncatheterization.  By time of discharge, his creatinine was 1.4\nand trending towards baseline.\n\n4.  Gastrointestinal:  On [**2598-4-15**], the patient was noted\nto have brown emesis, Gastroccult positive. Nasogastric lavage\nrevealed coffee grounds.  As there was a possibility of cardiac\ncatheterization in the near future, esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nwas performed in the peri myocardial infarction period.  On [**2598-4-17**] esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a single nonbleeding\nduodenal ulceration.  As such, the patient was started on\nProtonix 40 mg po b.i.d. for a 14 day course.\n\n5.  Neurology:  The patient was noted to be minimally responsive\non postoperative day number one with sluggish pupils.  His\nepidural was immediately discontinued with gradual clearing of\nhis mental status.  It is believed that he had an acute delirium\nin the setting of narcotic use, hospital infection, recent\nmyocardial infarction, renal dysfunction and possibly hypoxic\nbrain injury in the setting of severe hypotension and\nbradycardia.  By time of discharge, the patient was close to his\nbaseline mental status.  Patient was recovering well from his\nspine surgery utilizing a warm and form brace.  He was to be\ndischarged to rehabilitation for further physical therapy.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.  Atenolol 100 mg po b.i.d.\n2.  Glucophage 1000 mg po b.i.d.\n3.  Zestril 40 mg po q.d.\n4.

In the Oncology Clinic the patient's blood\npressure was 100\/60, pulse 84, respiratory rate 32, O2 sat\n90%, which decreased to 80% despite being on 15 liters of O2\nby nonrebreather mask.  The patient became more increasingly\nmore somnolent and lethargic and was transferred to the\nEmergency Room via EMS.\n\nIn the Emergency Department the patient was observed to have\nan ineffective agonal breathing.  Blood pressure 160\/63.\nHeart rate 120.  O2 sat 76% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  The\npatient was started on BiPAP with improvement of her O2 sats\n98 to 100%.  The patient was empirically treated with 20\nintravenous Lasix, Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous, Flagyl 500\nmg intravenous and Ampicillin 1 gram intravenous.  The\npatient became transiently hypotensive to 70s\/40s, which\nresponded well to 500 cc normal saline bolus.  The patient's\narterial blood gas was 7.29, 38, 54 and BiPAP of 10\/5, FIO2\nof 1.  The patient's bicarb was 14 and she was given one amp\nof bicarb.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.

She developed a fever to \n102 F, hypotension to SBP 90s today, and came to our emergency \nroom.  Husband first noted left elbow 3-4 weeks ago which \nresolved in 2 days after application of neosporin (there was a \nquestion of spider bite).  Then 3 days ago she noted erythema \nwhich increased and associated with increasing edema and \ntenderness.  Today, the patient was practically unable to move \nelbow due to pain.  She experienced fever and chills that began \nyesterday, but she did not take her temperature.  Her Review of \nSystem is notable for a new dry cough x 6 days.  She also \ndeveloped diarrhea but stopped 3 days ago when she stopped \ntaking Colace.  She has fatigue but no SOB, congestion, \nabdominal pain, dysuria, bright red blood per rectum, or melena. \n There was no trauma to elbow.  There was no recent sick \ncontacts or travel.\n\nRegarding her oncologic history, her symptoms began in late July \n2005 with headache, word-finding difficulties, memory loss, and \nconfusion.  She was found to have a left parietal brain lesion.  \nAfter subtotal resection on [**2877-6-25**], underwent involved-field \nXRT with concurrent temozolomid.  She also received 1 treatment \nwith CyberKnife radiosurgery to an enhancing lesion in the right \noccipital lobe, together with temozolomide.\n\nIn the emergency room, her temperature was 102.6 F, HR 130s \n(sinus tachycardia), and systolic BP 90s-100s (baseline SBP \n120s-130s). Her WBC was 0.3 with no neutrophils or bands.  Her \nU\/A showed no WBC but there was nitrates and bacteria.  Her \nserum lactate was 3.9.  Blood and urine cultures were sent. Her \nchest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but there was \nmild left lung apical patchy ground-glass opacity; there was a \nquestion of atelectasis versus pneumonia.  She received oxygen \nat 7 liters via nasal cannula in the emergency room but her \nsystolic BP persisted in 90s-100s.

Neutropenic Fever\/Hypotension:  In the FICU, the patient was \naggressively fluid resuscitated, and her blood pressure \nresponded without any pressor. Sources of infection included \nleft elbow bursitis\/cellulitis, pneumonia, and UTI.  In the \nsetting of neutropenic fever, the patient was started on broad \nspectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and \nazithromycin (for atypical pneumonia), as well as gentamicin x 1 \ndose in context of continued destabilization and need for double \ngram negative coverage.  Central venous pressure improved to \n[**6-16**] over the course of 48 hours, and blood pressures \nstabilized.  Patient had no more fever.  Patient received stress \ndose steroids as well as Neupogen.  Orthopedics was consulted \nfor her left elbow bursitis\/cellulitis.  X-ray and MRI did not \nreveal osteomyelitis.  Orthopedics felt that possible bursitis; \nhowever, symptoms improved with antibiotics.\n \nOn transfer to the OMED service, the patient was afebrile and \nhemodynamically stable.  She was continued on Neupogen, \nvancomycin, ceftazidime, and azythromycin. On [**2877-9-16**], given \nher enterococcal UTI is pansensitive and the patient no longer \nneutropenic, vancomycin and ceftazidime were discontinued and \ncefazolin IV was started to cover both enteroccocus and left \nelbow cellulitis.  Neupogen was discontinued on [**2877-9-17**].  \nAzythromycin was discontinued after completion of 7 day course \non [**2877-9-19**].  Also, on [**2877-9-19**], the left elbow had increased \nwarmth and erythema as well as enlargement of fluid sac.  Also, \npatient's WBC increased despite the discontinuation of Neupogen \nwas disproportionately high with a presence of dohl bodies and \ntoxic granulations on smears suggestive of undertreated or \npersistant infection.  Thus, cefazolin was discontinued, and \nvancomycin was restarted on [**2877-9-19**].  The left elbow responded \nwell to vancomycin and the fluid sac broke open spontaneously, \ndraining pus.  The patient had a PICC line placed in her right \narm and was discharged with 10 more days of vancomycin to finish \na 2 week course. \n\n2. Hypoxia: The paitnet required O2 supplement temporarily. CXR \nshowed small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. With \nincentive spirometry use, the patient's sat improved to 95% on \nRA. \n\n3. Glioblastoma Multiforme: Chemotherapy was held. Continued on \nKeppra and Decadron. Given on steroids, FS blood glucose was \nchecked 4 times daily and they were mostly in the 100's, not \nrequiring a long acting insulin. \n\n4. Transaminitis: She had elevated AST and ALT from [**2877-7-5**]. \nRechecked and was normal.\n\n5. Anxiety: Lorazepam prn helped.\n\n6. Prophylaxis: Sliding scale insulin and finger stick blood \nglucose given on steroids; PPI, subcutaneous heparin, and bowel \nregimen were administered as well.  \n\n7. FEN: Regular diet\n\n8.

Workup revealed an aortic dissection\nfrom his aortic valve to his infrarenal aorta. He was\ntransferred [**Hospital1 83**] for emergency aortic surgery.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Chronic anemia\n2.  Prostate cancer status post radiation therapy\n3.  Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy as a child\n\nMEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Folic acid daily and\nmultivitamin daily.\n\nALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam he is in bed, in no apparent\ndistress but slightly anxious. He is grossly neurologically\nintact. His pulmonary, coronary, abdomen and extremity exam\nis deferred.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the OR emergently after\nimmediate evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 330**], who noted that he was\nstable hemodynamically, had equal pulses and blood pressure\nin his arms and legs and was neurologically intact. He\nretained consent from the patient for emergency surgery, and\nthe patient was taken to the OR emergently on [**8-19**].\n\nOn [**8-19**] he underwent emergency ascending aortic\nreplacement with a 28 mm Gelweave graft by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 330**]. He\nwas transferred to the cardiothoracic ICU, a paced and stable\ncondition on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.2 mcg\/kg per minute\nand a titrated propofol drip. Circulatory arrest time was 20\nminutes. Please refer to the official operative report.\n\nLater that evening patient went back to the operating room\nfor high output from his chest tubes for re-exploration of\nhis mediastinum to address the issue of bleeding.\n\nOn postoperative day 1 he was on a Nipride drip at 2.2 mcg\/kg\nper minute, a nitroglycerin drip at 4 mcg\/kg per minute and a\npropofol drip at 50.\n\nPostoperative laboratories as follows: 7.8 white count,\nhematocrit 29.1, INR 1.1, _____ 3.2.\n\nHe had good breath sounds bilaterally. He had a systolic\nmurmur. His incision was clean, dry and intact. He had\nhypoactive bowel sounds with minimal  swelling of his\nextremities. Chest tubes remained in place, as did his Foley,\nwith a plan to slowly wake him and wean him gradually from\nthe ventilator.\n\nOn [**8-20**] the patient was extubated at approximately 2:30\nin the afternoon. He began Lasix diuresis, and on the 10th in\nthe afternoon, approximately 36 hours post surgery, he was\ndoing well, had been extubated. He appeared to be\nneurologically intact and was ready to move to the floor.\n\nHe had an acute neurologic event which was documented by Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 330**] with right-sided weakness. He became slump postured\nand slumped on his left side and unresponsive. He was\nintubated emergently and remained unresponsive and was seen\nimmediately by our neurology consult for CT scanning to\ndetermine if the cerebrovascular event. This was on\npostoperative day 2.\n\nIn the afternoon he was seen emergently by neurology service.\nOn exam, noted that his left pupil was completely blown at 8\nmm and nonreactive to light. Right pupil was sluggish and 1\nmm and slightly reactive to light. Please refer to the\ncomplete neurologic exam note.\n\nPatient was taken to the scanner. He had no spontaneous\nmovements or movements to any painful stimuli at that time.\nScan had shown possible diagnosis of a rostral basilar artery\nthrombosis with mid grain and rostral pontine dysfunction.\n\nInterventional neuroradiology was contacted with plans to do\nangiography. Patient was also seen by neurosurgery in\nconsultation to determine whether or not thrombolysis of the\nbasilar artery could be done. Neurosurgery determined that\ninterventional pathway was the direction to go for treating\nthe patient, and that there was no neurosurgical intervention\nat the time. The patient did have thrombolysis of his distal\nbasilar artery with no change in his neurologic status.\nPlease refer to the official note from interventional\nradiology.\n\nPatient remained on heparin for a basilar dissection, which\nwas documented. Patient evaluated continuously by Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 330**]. Given his prognosis, it was determined that the\nthrombolysis intra-arterially was the only reasonable salvage\nmaneuver, which was done.\n\nPatient was seen again by neurosurgery in the afternoon.\nPatient now had 2 blown pupils with no oculocephalic reflexes\nor gag or any withdrawal to pain. His sedation medications\nhad been turned off 2 hours prior to the examination. There\nwere no spontaneous respirations. This was discussed\nextensively by neurosurgery as well as the neurology team and\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9324**]. The patient's family was informed as to the very\ngrave prognosis to try and make a decision about the\npotential clinical care of the patient, given that brain\ndeath seemed likely at this point.\n\nOn the 11th the patient was examined again by neurosurgery\nwith no change. His pupils remained fixed and dilated without\nany oculocephalic or corneal gag reflexes. No response to\nstimulation. No spontaneous movement. Clinically, it was\ndetermined by neurosurgery that this was consistent with\nbrain death, and there was to be no neurosurgical\nintervention that could help. This was also discussed with\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 309**] of neurosurgery. The neurosurgery signed off. His\nexam did remain unchanged with no new events. His laboratory\nwork remained relatively stable. He remained intubated and\nsedated but not on any propofol and completely unresponsive\nto examination. He continued to receive supportive therapy\nand was on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1.75 mcg\/kg per minute.\n\nThe stroke consult team also examined the patient. Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], who discussed the case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as they\ncontinue to serially evaluate the patient. Clergy was called\nto talk to the family with support and discuss with them the\nevents. Patient's family was also seen by case management.\n\nOn postoperative day 4 there were no neurologic changes.\nPatient remained completely unchanged and unresponsive with\nfixed and dilated pupils. He remained on ventilator. His\nelectrolytes were repleted. Recommendation for EEG was made\nby neurology. Nutrition did follow up. The stroke consult\nservice with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] were also discussed\nthe patient again, and decision was made by the family after\na period of time to make the patient comfort measures only\nwith IV medication.

CK was 300 and\ntroponin less than 0.3.\n\nChest x-ray revealed no acute process.  Head CT revealed no\nacute bleed or mass lesion.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Cardiovascular - The patient was admitted to CCU for\nblood pressure control.  He was started on Labetalol drip\nwhich resulted in immediate significant drop in his blood\npressure requiring discontinuation of the Labetalol.\nFollowing this, he was started on Nipride drip with\nrelatively good control, but over the first 24 hours, his\nblood pressure returned to [**Location 2541**] and all drips were\nsubsequently discontinued.  At this point, autonomous testing\nwas arranged and the patient was found to have severe\nautonomic dysfunction.  Given this finding, it was believed\nthat he would benefit from pyramidal corticoids which was\nFlorinef on which he was started.  In the meantime, his beta\nblocker and ace inhibitor were currently discontinued.  His\nblood pressure well controlled after that.  He required only\nthe addition of Clonidine patch.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2830**] has a history of multiple vascular\ninterventions on his left leg including femoral distal bypass\nin [**3105-3-19**], but has a chronic pain and a nonhealing\nulcer on his left foot, which has failed conservative\ntherapy.  With the exception of his pain Mr. [**Known patient lastname 2830**] felt well\non admission.  He denies fevers or chills, chest pain,\nshortness of breath.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for end stage renal disease\nsecondary to ANCA vasculitis.  The patient was hemodialysis\nsince [**3102**].  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes\nsince [**3083**].  The patient has a history of peripheral vascular\ndisease as noted above including previously mentioned left\nleg interventions as well as amputation of fifth metatarsals\non his right foot.  The patient has a history of congestive\nheart failure with an echocardiogram in [**3106-2-16**]\nshowing a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 to 45%,\nright ventricular dilatation and mild pulmonary hypertension,\nas well as mild global right ventricular hypokinesis.  The\npatient has a history of atrial fibrillation status post\ncardioversion.  The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism,\nhypertension, history of previous cerebrovascular accident,\nhistory of throat cancer status post chemotherapy and\nradiation therapy, history of MRSA bacteremia, history of\nGERD.  History of chronic aspiration pneumonias status post\nPEG placement.\n\nALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Hydralazine to which\nhe developed a vasculitis.  Cipro to which he gets swelling,\nace inhibitors to which he gets swelling and Vancomycin to\nwhich the patient gets hives.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin, which was initially on\nhold for surgery, subQ heparin, Levofloxacin 250 mg po once a\nday, which was begun on [**5-23**] for aspiration pneumonia, Epogen\n1300 units subQ once a week, Serevent two puffs b.i.d.,\nLevothyroxine 200 micrograms po q day, quinine sulfate 325 mg\npo Monday, Wednesday and Friday prehemodialysis, Norvasc 5\ngrams Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, 5 grams twice a day\nTuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Lopressor 25 mg po\ntwice a day.  Calcium carbonate 4 grams po twice a day.\nFlovent 110 micrograms three puffs b.i.d., Claritin 10 mg po\nonce a day and Percocet prn.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for a forty pack year smoking\nhistory.  The patient quit smoking in [**3093**].\n\nLABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of\n6.4, hematocrit of 28.7, which is around baseline for the\npatient.  His INR was 1.4.  PTT was 36.3 and his BMP was\nwithin normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile\nwith a temperature of 98.8, pulse 74, blood pressure 136\/62,\nsating 94% on 2 liters O2.  Generally, he was cachectic ill\nappearing male in no acute distress.  He had no JVD, but his\nlungs were remarkable for bibasilar rales.  Cardiovascular is\nregular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Abdominal\nexamination was benign with the PEG site being clean, dry and\nintact.  Extremities left lower extremity was bandage with\nthe bandage being clean, dry and intact.  No edema.  Chronic\nvenostasis changes.  Right lower extremity had no edema and\nalso had evidence of chronic venous changes.  Left AV fistula\nhad palpable thrill and a good bruit.\n\nIMPRESSION:  In short, this was a 65 year-old male with end\nstage renal disease and peripheral vascular disease and a\nmyriad of other medical problems that was admitted for\nelective left below the knee amputation secondary to\nnonhealing ulcer.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Vascular:  The patient underwent left\nbelow the knee amputation as planned on [**5-23**] and was doing\nwell postoperatively until [**5-27**] when he began having mental\nstatus changes.  Workup of the mental statue changes is\ndiscussed in the endocrine section below.  The patient's\nwound did not heal well and became necrotic, gangrenous and\nthus the patient was taken back to have his below the knee\namputation revised to an above the knee amputation on [**3106-6-6**].  Postoperatively the patient's wound healed well\nand at the time of discharge was clean, dry and intact with\nno erythema and no exudate.\n\n2.  Endocrine:  The patient is a known type 2 diabetic who\nwas taking Micronase at home that was discontinued on\nadmission, because the patient was NPO for surgery.  The\npatient's sugars were fine postop until he began having\nmental status changes on the 9th where he became lethargic,\nnoninteractive with his family, narcotics were discontinued\nwithout results and blood sugars were noted to be in the low\n40s to 70s.  Review of medications revealed that the patient\nhad been given Glyburide due to a nonupdated medication sheet\nbrought from home.  Blood sugars remained in the 20 to 80\nrange.  The patient despite boluses with D50 was started on a\nD10 drip.  His sugars were maintained within normal limits.\nUnfortunately Glyburide does not clear the system with\ndialysis, so the patient was maintained on a D10W drip with\nD50 boluses needed throughout the course of the next three\ndays while waiting for Glyburide to clear his system.\nSubsequent to weaning the patient off of the D10 drip he was\nmaintained on standing doses of NPH insulin and with sliding\nscale.\n\n3.  Infectious disease:  The patient was afebrile throughout\nthe course of his hospital stay until [**6-6**] when he spiked\na temperature.  Subsequent blood cultures grew MRSA.  Because\nthe patient's allergy to Vanco he was started on Synercid.\nThe patient underwent a TTE to rule out endocarditis, which\nshowed no vegetations.  He also had another positive MRSA\nblood culture on [**6-12**] after the placement of a PICC line.\nThe PICC line was removed after subsequent catheter tip\nculture grew MRSA positive.  The patient remained afebrile\nwith negative blood cultures from MRSA for the remainder of\nhis hospital stay and was sent home for an add two weeks of\nSynercid.  The patient also had a positive blood cultures,\nwhich grew B fragilis.  The source for this was thought to be\nthe sacral decubitus ulcer.  The patient was started on\nFlagyl po for this and given a two week course per ID\nrecommendation.\n\n4.  Cardiac:  The patient had a history of atrial\nfibrillation, but was in normal sinus rhythm on admission.\nThroughout the course of his stay he had episodic atrial\nfibrillation, but remained hemodynamically stable.  The\npatient was restarted on his Coumadin prior to discharge with\nhopes of titrating him back to a therapeutic level.  The\npatient is followed by his nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1024**].\n\n5.  Sacral decubitus ulcer:  During the course of his\nhospital stay due to his prolonged immobilization\npostoperative and while being in the Intensive Care Unit the\npatient developed severe sacral decubitus ulcer stage 3 to 4,\nwhich required multiple debridement by plastic surgery while\nhe was in house.  Because the patient's peripheral vascular\ndisease it was thought that the patient is probably not a\ngood candidate for flap reconstruction.  The patient was\nreferred to general surgeon Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for follow up\nand further debridement of this wound as an outpatient and\ncontinued on wet to dry dressings three times a day.\n\n6.  Pulmonary:  The patient had a history of chronic\naspiration pneumonias and had difficulty being weaned from\noxygen as an inpatient.  Thus he was treated with a short\ncourse of Levofloxacin while in house even though his chest\nx-ray remained clear without signs of pneumonia during the\ncourse of his stay.  The patient was also continued on his\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease inhalers and oxygen\nprn.\n\n7.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient\ncontinued G tube feeds throughout the course of his stay.\n\n8.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had repeated diarrhea\nfollowing initiation of Synercid treatment.  He was C-diff\nnegative multiple times and it was thought that the diarrhea\nwas secondary to antibiotic use.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged home on\n[**3106-6-25**] in good condition to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] regarding treatment of his sacral ulcer, with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding his atrial fibrillation and cardiac\nissues, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2831**] his primary care attending regarding\nhis general care and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1024**] for issues surrounding\nhis hemodialysis.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

She had apparently been well until about\n8 a.m. on the day of admission but at 8:20 was found leaning\nto the left side of a chair with right gaze deviation.  She\nwas brought to the Emergency Department within one hour and\nnoted to be somnolent but arousable, agitated, with fluent\nspeech, and following simple commands.  She had a left\nhemiplegia with forced conjugate eye deviation to the right.\nHead CT showed an old thalamic lacunar, but magnetic\nresonance imaging confirmed the presence of an almost\ncomplete left territory stroke with some sparing of the\nvasoganglia in the left temporal lobe.\n\nBecause of the rapid speed with which she was brought to the\nEmergency Room, she was given intravenous t-PA  and admitted\nto the Intensive Care Unit.  Overnight, she became a little\nmore somnolent, but a repeat head CT did not demonstrate any\nnew hemorrhage.  She was transferred to the Neurology floor\non [**3162-3-21**].\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history was significant\nfor)\n1.  Diabetes mellitus.\n2.  Hypertension.\n3.  Atrial fibrillation, for which she had been Coumadin but\nwhich had been discontinued because of retinal hemorrhage.\n4.  Congestive heart failure.\n5.  Prior spinal surgery.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at the time of\ntransfer included digoxin, Paxil, Mavik, Avandia, Calcitrel,\nCelebrex, Duragesic patch, Lasix, and insulin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General medical\nexamination revealed heart with an irregularly irregular\nrhythm.  Blood pressure was 178 to 180\/80.  There were no\ncarotid bruits.  There were some coarse crackles at the left\nlung base.  The abdomen was soft and nontender.  On\nneurologic examination her eyes were closed, did not open to\nvoice or noxious stimulation.  There was no verbal output or\nability to follow commands.  The pupils were symmetric and\nreactive.  The was conjugate eye deviation to the right, and\nthe eyes could not be moved to the left with oculocephalic\nreflex.  There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold and\ndecreased tone in the left eyelid.  The left arm and leg were\nflexed with nonvolitional movement.  There was some minimal\nwithdraw of the left arm and legs from noxious stimulation.\nThe right arm and leg moved spontaneously.  The left plantar\nresponsive extensor on the right was flexor.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the general\nNeurology floor for observation.  After an extensive\ndiscussion with the family, it was decided that in addition\nto the do not resuscitate\/do not intubate status which she\nhad had in the unit that given her extreme lack of\nimprovement with t-PA, and the fact that she had multiple\nmedical problems due to her advanced age, that she would be\nchanged to basically a comfort measures only status.\n\nWe continued to give her intravenous fluids as necessary,\ncontinued the medications she was on currently, and gave her\nLasix for diuresis when her respiratory rate would increase\nand her lungs would sound more congested.\n\nOver the next couple of days she did seem to improve a little\nbit.  She became more arousable and was able to mumble some\nsimple words and talk with her family at that point in time.\nBecause of the improvement, she was taken off comfort\nmeasures only status.  However, the wishes of the family were\nthat if there was a intercurrent infection or other severe\ncomplications from which she would be unable to recover that\nthis would be treated expectantly and there would not be\nmajor intervention undertaken.\n\nWithin a few days she had returned basically to her baseline\nof poor responsiveness, and her examination was basically the\nsame as was described above.  A chest x-ray was obtained\nafter her respiratory rate remained elevated for 24 hours in\nthe range of 40 breaths to 60 breaths per minute, and the\npicture no longer seemed consistent with congestive heart\nfailure, but instead there were some patchy infiltrates of\nthe left lung consistent with early pneumonia versus\natelectasis.  This was felt to most likely be due to\naspiration as she had had a poor level of arousal for several\ndays.\n\nAt the request of the family, and after a lengthy discussion\nwith the neurology team, the family, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4058**] (neurology\nattending) it was decided that it would be most appropriate\nfor her to be returned to [**Location 4059**] measures only status.  She\nappeared to be suffering from air hunger at that point in\ntime, and so she was given morphine to decrease her\ndiscomfort, and this did slow her respiratory rate, and she\nappeared more comfortable.  She continued to deteriorate,\nrequired increasing doses of morphine and was placed on a\nmorphine drip.\n\nShe continued to deteriorate and passed away on the evening\nof [**3162-3-26**].\n\n\n\n                          [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number 4060**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4061**]\n\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**3162-3-27**]  11:04\nT:  [**3162-3-28**]  13:30\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 4062**]\nSigned electronically by: DR.
